According to a research, children who grew up constantly exposed to high levels of pollution are more at risk of developing depression by the time they reach 18. Moreover, outdoor and indoor air pollution can contribute to a host of health problems ranging from asthma to respiratory infections, and it may even exacerbate existing mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression. For overall wellbeing and happiness, it's important to create a healthy living environment and make sure that the air we breathe is as clean and pure as it can be. Here's how indoor air can affect mental health, and what we can do to improve our home or workplace's air quality.It can affect happinessRoughly one-third of the world's population has to contend with dangerous levels of indoor air pollution, which is caused by factors such as cooking with wood-burning stoves, cigarette smoke, fumes from toxic cleaning solutions, and mold. Constant exposure from these pollutants not only causes eye irritation, respiratory problems and cancer, but research has shown that it also has an effect on our emotional well-being. Data from the study shows that there is a strong correlation between pollution and happiness levels, and that those who live in highly polluted areas are less happy than those who live in areas with clean air. To clean indoor air, you can use an air purifier to get rid of harmful particulates and toxins. Homeowners and office workers may also open their windows regularly to let some fresh air in. If airing out the home becomes a problem in winter, combat the dry air outside by using a whole house humidifier to reduce the likelihood of developing common winter health conditions such as dry skin, scratchy throats, or allergy symptoms. These systems can be attached to your ductwork and can work alongside a furnace, allowing you to humidify your home without sacrificing warmth.It may trigger anxiety symptomsA Harvard study has shown that constant exposure to indoor and outdoor pollution can trigger symptoms of anxiety, which include a tendency to worry, fearfulness, and avoidance. Having anxiety can affect everything from school and work performance to making decisions. Along with counseling and medication, it's important to keep the air in the home and work environment as clean as possible to reduce anxiety symptoms. One of the most natural ways to do this is by having a few indoor plants that can clear the air of toxins and particulates. Some of the best air purifying plants include rubber plants, Boston fern, peace lily, devil's ivy, snake plant, chrysanthemum, and English ivy.Other ways to purify indoor airApart from using air purifiers and having potted plants inside the home, there are other ways to clean one's indoor air without breaking the bank. For instance, one can use a ceiling or stand fan to keep the air circulating in rooms and keep stale air out. Another way to reduce toxins in the air is by using natural cleaning ingredients, such as baking soda, lemon juice and vinegar to clean surfaces. These ingredients can clean effectively without giving off harmful fumes the way ammonia or other commercially-available cleaners can.  ​Keeping one's living environment in optimum condition can help to promote better mental health. Keep your indoor air clean and pure to stay well and have a better quality of life. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Stress can take a toll on our physical, emotional, and mental health over time. It distracts us and drags focus away from the important things in life such as friends, family, and career. It can be tough to break the cycle on our own, but with trained help, it’s possible to change your thinking patterns and work towards a clear, sharp mind. Client-centered counseling services can help patients to reduce their stress levels and improve mental clarity in a number of ways.Identify Your ProblemsFor the most part, the stress we feel in life is completely in our own heads. We place undue significance on people, places, or events that don’t necessarily merit the time and energy. From the inside, however, it can be tough to recognize what’s worth worrying over and what’s not. A counseling session can help bring to life unnecessary stress in a patient’s life and help them to come up with viable solutions to resolve the issue.Set Reasonable GoalsEven if a patient is able to identify internal issues, it can still be a challenge to work towards fixing them. Many patients are tempted to try and tackle all of their problems at once, but an overly ambitious goal may end up being a disheartening distraction. Counselors are trained to help set realistic goals and milestones along the path towards a patient’s recovery. Small steps, such as taking time out of the day to meditate or focusing on positive thoughts, can help patients to improve their focus over time.Change Negative Thinking PatternsNegative thinking can quickly invade your mind, seeping into your train of thought and forcing it off the rails. Counseling aims to help patients change their thinking patterns to develop a more positive outlook on life. Not only can this help to treat mental health issues such as depression and anxiety, but it can also help to clear the mind and make it easier to think straight, even when feeling stressed. Stress can make it difficult to clear our minds and focus on the task at hand. People who are feeling overwhelmed may see it affecting their performance at work, at home, or within their social circle. A trained counselor can help patients to regain their clarity of mind by helping them to identify and solve personal issues while improving thinking habits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

FranklIn 1942 Frankl, along with his wife  and parents were deported to a Nazi concentration camp. In 1944 his  wife and parents died; Frankl was liberated in 1945. He and his sister  (who escaped Europe before the war) were the only survivors of his  immediate relatives.Because of the suffering experienced in this  camp – his own and others – he came to the conclusion that even in the  bleakest of situations, life can be meaningful. Hence, there can be  meaning in suffering. He called his particular approach Logotherapy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExistential Therapy Today \n\nWhat does existential therapy look like now? Primary interest would be invested in these areas:• helping the client to live more authentically. To be less concerned with superficial concerns.• to take responsibility for their actions. To take ownership of their lives.• to find meaning in their lives. To be able to answer the question “What am I here for?”• living in the here and now. To live more fully, understanding that “this too shall pass.”*****In Sample Session Eight client Mary has her \"dark night of the soul\" after achieving a major breakthrough in her vocational and financial life.

Now she is trying to find her place in a larger world.Closely related to meaning-therapy is “bibliotherapy” – which is the selection of reading material for a client that has relevance to that person's life situation.For example, a mother at home with small children might relate to Anne Green in the humor book “Petcetera: In Fine Feather.” A person struggle with cancer would be able to relate to Diane Sim’s \"A Life Consumed: Lilly Samson’s Dispatches from the TB Front.\" Those trying to make sense of a personal history that seems to have no rhyme or reason could enjoy Rick deMeulles' “Ramasseur.” A senior citzen would find a nostalgic treat in reading John Forrest’s \"Angels Stars and Trees: Tales of Christmas Magic.\" Ideally, the protagonist with whom the reader is likely to identify with comes to a hopeful resolution of, or at least a response to, her / his problem.\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading and  Video \nBooks “Man's Search for Meaning” by Viktor E.

While many people embrace getting older, others may dread the physical and mental effects of aging. Getting older often forces people to face their own mortality and confront the realities of their aging. Geriatric counseling, therefore, becomes an important vehicle to help people share their fears and tackle life's challenges while giving people the tools to effectively manage the transition into their older years.The Work of a Geriatric CounselorThe overall aim of geriatric counseling is to improve and enrich the lives of seniors. Geriatric counselors primarily provide physical and psychological assessment services. However, they also offer counseling, direct care, and mental health treatment. They will also help a senior tackle any issues that could interfere with their quality of life. They also specialize in resolving issues that frequently arise for older people living in long term care and assisted living facilities, while working closely with staff responsible for delivering skilled nursing care.Getting to Know the ClientWhile a geriatric counselor will work closely with the client to understand their needs and requirements, they will also liaise with other family members and health care providers. They will also review the individual’s medical history to ensure they understand their past and present medical situation, including any medications or treatment they are receiving. Once they have this information and a better picture of the person’s circumstances, they will create a plan that’s aimed at making the older person’s life easier, safer and healthier. This can include a variety of tasks such as grocery shopping, making doctor’s appointments, arranging transportation, completing paperwork or managing the client’s moments. The geriatric counselor will also help the person connect with social services and other assistance programs.Providing Mental, Emotional and Practical SupportWith over 6.5 million Americans aged over 65 experiencing depression, geriatric counselors will also keep a close eye on the person’s emotional and mental health. As we get older, we all have to face a variety of challenges and changes. Many of us will be confronted with the pressures of a second career, low income, providing care for a loved one or receiving care, bereavement, physical illness or pain, terminal disease, cognitive decline, depression or mental illness. A geriatric counselor can help a client cope better with these issues and provide crucial guidance on how they can deal effectively with these challenges.Becoming A Geriatric CounselorA geriatric counselor will generally be required to have a background of working in mental health and counseling. They will need to have some knowledge of mental and emotional disorders, counseling strategies along with other therapeutic interventions. They will need to have a good understanding of the issues facing the older population and understand their role in helping clients adjust to these challenges. The specific requirements needed for a career in geriatric counseling varies from state to state, but a good understanding of mental health issues and a bachelor's degree in a mental health related field is generally a good place to start. As America’s elderly population continues to grow, geriatric counseling services have become crucial in ensuring that older people can look forward to a happy, healthy and comfortable future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

While many people embrace getting older, others may dread the physical and mental effects of aging. Getting old",
            "er often forces people to face their own mortality and confront the realities of their aging. Geriatric counseling, therefore, becomes an important vehicle to help people share their fears and tackle life's challenges while giving people the tools to effectively manage the transition into their older years.The Work of a Geriatric CounselorThe overall aim of geriatric counseling is to improve and enrich the lives of seniors. Geriatric counselors primarily provide physical and psychological assess",
            "ment services. However, they also offer counseling, direct care, and mental health treatment. They will also help a senior tackle any issues that could interfere with their quality of life. They also specialize in resolving issues that frequently arise for older people living in long term care and assisted living facilities, while working closely with staff responsible for delivering skilled nursing care.Getting to Know the ClientWhile a geriatric counselor will work closely with the client to u",
            "nderstand their needs and requirements, they will also liaise with other family members and health care providers. They will also review the individual’s medical history to ensure they understand their past and present medical situation, including any medications or treatment they are receiving. Once they have this information and a better picture of the person’s circumstances, they will create a plan that’s aimed at making the older person’s life easier, safer and healthier. This can include a ",
            "variety of tasks such as grocery shopping, making doctor’s appointments, arranging transportation, completing paperwork or managing the client’s moments. The geriatric counselor will also help the person connect with social services and other assistance programs.Providing Mental, Emotional and Practical SupportWith over 6.5 million Americans aged over 65 experiencing depression, geriatric counselors will also keep a close eye on the person’s emotional and mental health. As we get older, we all h",
            "ave to face a variety of challenges and changes. Many of us will be confronted with the pressures of a second career, low income, providing care for a loved one or receiving care, bereavement, physical illness or pain, terminal disease, cognitive decline, depression or mental illness. A geriatric counselor can help a client cope better with these issues and provide crucial guidance on how they can deal effectively with these challenges.Becoming A Geriatric CounselorA geriatric counselor will gen",
            "erally be required to have a background of working in mental health and counseling. They will need to have some knowledge of mental and emotional disorders, counseling strategies along with other therapeutic interventions. They will need to have a good understanding of the issues facing the older population and understand their role in helping clients adjust to these challenges. The specific requirements needed for a career in geriatric counseling varies from state to state, but a good understan",
            "ding of mental health issues and a bachelor's degree in a mental health related field is generally a good place to start. As America’s elderly population continues to grow, geriatric counseling services have become crucial in ensuring that older people can look forward to a happy, healthy and comfortable future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Chronic sleep deprivation plays a significant role in tragic air and road accidents, disrupts the ability to focus, and affects mood. It also stops the body from strengthening the immune system, increases the risk of respiratory diseases, contributes to obesity, and is linked to heart disease, stroke, and Type 2 diabetes. Around 4% of adults are treated with prescription medication to get a good night’s sleep. As noted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, however, there has been a dramatic rise in emergency room visits related to prescription medication. The good news is that there is an effective alternative to sleeping pills like Ambien; one that has no side-effects and that can make a big difference quickly: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which is considered a ‘gold standard’ treatment for everything from stress to substance abuse.Studies on CBT and insomniaA study by Matthew D Mitchell et al looked into the effectiveness of CBT vs sleeping pills. The results showed that CBT has superior effectiveness to benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine drugs in the long term. The researchers recommended that primary care providers should consider CBT as a first-line treatment option for insomnia. Another interesting study by Nishith P et al on six females with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) found that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy brought about improved sleep quality (including during the REM ‘deep sleep’ phase), fewer sleep disturbances, and less daytime dysfunction. The findings are vital because REM sleep stimulates the brain regions used in learning. In this phase of sleep, the body releases Human Growth Hormone (HGH), a powerful substance that plays a key role in cellular repair – thus promoting the elimination of toxins, tissue repair and regrowth, bone and muscle formation, and immune system strengthening.How can CBT help?In CBT, a trained counselor or therapist helps patients understand the inexorable link between thoughts, feelings, and behavior. It is fascinating for many patients to discover that sometimes, by changing one behavior, the way they perceive a person or situation can change for the better. When it comes to sleep in particular, the therapist may recommend different techniques, including improving the sleep environment (by ensuring the bedroom is comfortable and free of televisions and other devices and gadgets). They may also suggest meditation or guided imagery exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, sleep restriction (lying in bed only at bedtime), stimulus control therapy (which encourages individuals to leave the bed if they aren’t asleep within 20 minutes), and the adoption of healthy habits (such as avoiding caffeine in the afternoon, and exercising regularly).​When people have a problem as seemingly insurmountable as insomnia, the tendency can be to reach for a ‘quick fix’. Sadly, medication can be prescribed without consideration for natural therapies, which include CBT, found in many studies to be effective at battling insomnia. If you are finding it difficult to sleep, consider CBT as a way to learn valuable techniques (including relaxation and good sleep hygiene) that will serve you well for many years to come. Sometimes, making just a few changes can have a big difference in terms of quality of life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The name is sort of cute but the feelings of anxiety and depression that some people experience on Sundays can be anything but. If you experience the Sunday Scaries on a regular basis, you may feel robbed of what should be time for relaxation on the weekends, or you may have a hard time getting ready to take on the rest of the week. You’re not alone and you don’t have to take on the Sunday Scaries all alone. This is why we want you to have the following resources and tips. Self-Care Can Make a Real Difference  Now, you likely already know this, but like so many other parents, you may be struggling to fit self-care into your Sunday routine—not to mention your hectic everyday lifestyle. Try these tips:Know that self-care doesn’t have to be time-consuming or complicated to work.As an example, you can spend a few minutes journaling to improve your mental health.Or, you can set aside some time on Sunday morning to practice mindful meditation.Learn how to make time for self-care and develop a routine.  So Can Taking Care of Your Mental Health  Self-care is essential for managing your emotional well-being, but sometimes it’s just not enough. That’s okay and you should feel okay about using these links to reach out for help:While dealing with mental health issues may feel scary, know that help is available.It’s important to recognize the signs of bad energy in your home.This is key when the Sunday Scaries may be a symptom of a general anxiety disorder.If you do seek professional help, it can be a good idea to know what to expect.Managing mental health can be especially important when you’re a new mum.  Sundays Can Also Be Focused on Family Time  If you’re a mum, focusing on self-care and overall mental health is a must for dealing with Sunday Scaries. But it also helps to have something to look forward to, like time with family.Want to combine self-care and family time? Start a yoga practice together.You could also reserve some time on Sundays for time in nature, like a nice hike.Before you can make these plans, you’ll need to find ways to streamline your to-dos.  When you’re a busy mum juggling a million responsibilities and worries, it makes sense that Sundays feel pretty scary. Remember, whether it’s Sunday, Monday, or any other day of the week, your mental health and self-care habits should be a top priority. There are also practical ways to space out your errands during the week so you can focus on family and relaxation on Sunday. Combining all of these tips should help to chase Sunday Scaries away. This guide was brought to you by Basic Counseling Skills, a free online resource geared to the needs of University and College Students, Health Care Practitioners, Volunteers, and New Counselors.

Then the task is to identify what the  triggers may and find solutions, or at least reasonable responses to  these.*****First of all we need to understand what a mood is before we can map it.  A mood  is a relatively long lasting emotional state and has a positive or  negative valence. In other words, people often speak of being in a good  mood or a bad mood. Variants tend to be “really good mood” or “really  bad mood.” When we aren’t experiencing one or the other we may describe  ourselves as “ambi-valent” or ambivalent.Levels and type of mood  can vary from person to person. Optimistic people (learned or natural)  tend to have better moods for longer periods of time. Pessimistic people  (learned or natural) – bad moods for-seemingly-ever. 1.\tSymptoms of Bad or Sad Moods \t•\tanger•\tweepiness•\tirritability•\tlethargy•\tsleep disturbance (insomnia or oversleeping)•\tanxiety•\thopelessness•\tnegative self talk•\tloss of energy and interest•\tdifficulty communication (slow thought processesing)  2.\tMappingYour map is a  weekly schedule  that lists every day of the week and breaks the day up into at least four sections – five is better.  For example:•\t6 am to 9 am•\t9 am to 12 noon•\t12 noon to 3 pm•\t3pm to 6 pm•\t6 pm to 9 pm•\t9 pm to midnightGranted  you may not be awake during the early or late time slot – but this is a  topic to be covered in holistic health.  Suffice it to say, your mom  was right – early to bed, early to rise ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\tRating your Moods\n\nFor one week I want you to carry your weekly schedule sheet with you do some mood mapping - rate each section from one to five:1 – very bad (or very sad)2 – bad (or sad)3 – ambivalent, neither good nor bad (happy or sad)4 - good (happy)5 – very good (or very happy)If you prefer, you can use faces to do your mood mapping.  For example:  Ideally you would map for a month – especially if you are a female.  There is a day/month/year mood tracker at  http://www.medhelp.org/   at the top right hand corner.But you must map for at least a week.  What we are looking for is a pattern. 4.\tPatternsWhen are you happy?  When are you sad?  When are you ambivalent?What were you doing just before or during that particular mood?5.\tIdentification of TriggerIs there a mood trigger?  Common triggers of low mood THAT CAN BE MODIFIED include:•\tlack of sleep•\tlack of exercise•\tjunk food or lack of food•\tcaffeine•\talcohol•\ttoo much to do•\theadache caused by dehydration•\tloneliness•\tmajor change in routine ie preparing for or returning from vacation•\tcluttered house or office (out of control)These too are common triggers of sadness or grouchiness, but are harder (though not impossible) to modify:•\tfinancial worries•\tworkplace stress•\trelationship problems•\tschool related stress•\thormonal swing•\tpoor health of self or other•\tchange in medication•\tlack of control over work or home environment – ie noise, chemicalsAnd of course there are world events you and I have no control over:•\twar or totalitarian regime•\tnatural disastersNote:  If you are consistently feeling bad or neutral, you need to see a  health professional right now. You may have a physical or mental health  condition that warrants immediate attention.  Do not proceed until you  have made the necessary appointments, or gone to a walk-in or emergency  department.  You can still benefit from the Self-Help section – but you  need additional help right now! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Strategizing\n It is not enough to say, after you have done a week or two of mood  mapping, “Oh, I see why I may feel this way…”  You also need to address  the underlying problem.  Don’t agonize – strategize.  What might this  look like?  Remember our client Mary in the  Sample Sessions? Her symptoms were:•\tweepiness. She felt weepy “all the time.”•\tloss of energy and interest. She was failing at school.•\tnegative self talk. She thought her boyfriend didn’t love her anymore.• \tirritability and hopelessness. Her parents were driving her crazy with  their phones calls and insistence she be a straight A student.Mary did some mood mapping and discovered her triggers included:•\tsleeping in and missing class•\tbeing alone in the evening•\trelationship issues with Andy and with her parents.•\ther debt problem•\thow to get a well-paying, meaningful job.The first two challenges, plus her relationship with Andy, she could address right away by:•\tgoing to bed and getting up with Andy•\tgoing to classes•\tgetting tutoring•\tsharing feelings with a friend more, so as to not overburden Andy•\tidentifying a time to do housework with Andy• \tpicking the time she would answer the phone when her parents called, or  initiating a once a week check in for a limited amount of time.But  dealing with her parents, getting a good job and paying off her  substantial debt required lots of planning and determination.  Some  folks call this “BAM” – Brains And Motivation! Not immediately  addressed with Mary were food and exercise. This is unfortunate because  changing these two things makes an immediate and incredible difference.  See the book “Calm Energy” by Robert Thayer listed at the bottom of this  webpage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Work \nI encourage you to recruit a friend to act as an “accountability  partner” and support person through this mood mapping exercise. It is too easy to quit or to get bogged down in negative emotions.  OK, here we go…1.\tKnow what your symptoms are – especially for negative moods.2.\tDesign a  weekly schedule  for mood mapping or get one from the  medhelp website. 3.\tMap and rate your moods for at least a week – ideally a month.4.\tIdentify a pattern.  Are you happy when with people? Are you sad in the evenings? 5. \tLook for triggers. Note: If you are consistently depressed or feel  numb, you need immediate medical and mental health attention.6.\tStrategize. Involve your friend if you can.  For example:Short Term Problems and Strategies•\tI cry in the  evenings because I miss my partner... so – I will find a different  person to call every night at around the time I normally get weepy.•\tI get angry when I have to do groceries on a Saturday…so – I will pick them up after work on Friday. Then I relax better.•\tI stay up too late on the internet…so – I will entice myself to bed with a good book.Long Term Problems and Strategies• \tMy mom is going to be unhappy in the nursing home for a long time…so – I  may need antidepressants (“natural” or pharmaceudical) for the next  little while.•\tI cannot get out of debt with my current job and I  cannot afford to go to school … so – I am going to investigate  apprenticeship opportunities with my local resource center.•\tI am  concerned about my 21 year old child. He/she won’t go to school or try  to get a job. We’ve taken him/her for counseling and tried meds…so – I  am going to have to give him an ultimatum.  *****Some  problems, such as war and disaster - cannot be addressed individually,  let alone solved – sometimes within our lifetimes. This is where  developing an existential outlook becomes particularly crucial. By this I  mean finding your purpose in any life situation.

It is well worth watching the whole series! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN2UeWit7xA&feature=related \n\n\n\nIn this whole series of studies that we've done, the more you walk in a day, the more energy you experience. That's a little counter-intuitive because you would think that when you expend energy, you would not feel as energetic afterwards. But, it turns out that it produces more energy. – Dr. R.

Cleanliness also supports your physical and mental health. Read on to learn why cleaning your house is good for your health and how you can establish a cleaning habit that sticks.Cleaning for Your HealthA clean home is safer for you and your family. Cleanliness also supports mental wellness by reducing a source of chronic stress. These are six ways a clean home can benefit you:Reduce allergy and asthma symptoms. Regular cleaning removes dust mites, pet dander, and mold, all of which are common allergy triggers.Increase safety. Clutter is not only a fall hazard, it's also a fire danger. Fire spreads faster in a cluttered home, and clutter can hinder evacuation and rescue efforts.Deter pests. Food messes attract rodents and insects. Pests spread bacteria and parasites and trigger allergy and asthma symptoms.Swap mental fatigue for mental clarity. Living in a messy home is like constantly staring at a to-do list. A clean home lets your eyes and your mind relax so you can focus on what matters.Minimize stress and frustration. Being unable to find what you need not only wastes time, it also triggers intense frustration. Clean, organized spaces are also considered more calming by many.Instill a sense of pride. An unannounced visit when your home is a mess is downright anxiety inducing. A clean home enables you to stay socially active without the stress.Essential Tools for a Clean HomeYou can’t keep you home clean without the right tools. These are the cleaning implements every house should have.A vacuum cleanerA good vacuum makes light work of cleaning the floors. If lugging a heavy corded vacuum stops you from vacuuming, add a cordless vacuum to your cleaning toolkit. Today's cordless vacuums have more power and longer-lasting batteries than prior versions. That makes them an ideal tool for quick daily cleanups, even in homes with pets. If you have allergies, choose a model with a HEPA filter.A mop and bucketVacuuming only cleans loose debris from floors, not stuck-on messes. For those, you'll need a mop and bucket.Cloths or ragsCloths are the ultimate multipurpose cleaning tool. Microfiber cloths are great for dusting, but even old scraps of fabric will work for wiping down surfaces around the home.A scrub brushSome cleaning jobs need a little more elbow grease. Use scrub brushes to clean grout, showers and bathtubs, toilets, and other tough jobs.Cleaning ingredientsDIY cleaners are cheaper and less toxic than store-bought products. Stock up on baking soda, white vinegar, borax, and spray bottles, and you can make cleaning solutions for most messes in your home.Creating a Cleaning HabitFor most of us, the hardest part isn't knowing how to clean or which tools to use — it's getting into the habit. When you clean sporadically, your house falls into disarray between cleaning sprees. Only upon adopting a daily cleaning habit do you achieve a consistently clean home. If you struggle to maintain cleanliness at home, try these tips:Set a schedule. It's harder to blow off chores when you've made concrete plans. Decide how frequently you'll complete routine chores and schedule them in manageable time chunks.Give everything a place. Belongings that have designated homes are more likely to get put away. If you can't find a place for something, consider whether you truly need it.Address recurring messes. If you constantly misplace keys, trip over shoes by the door, or leave clothes strewn about the house, create simple solutions to these messes. Catch-all dishes, storage baskets, and shelves are easy ways to corral clutter.Tidy up before bed. Little messes inevitably accumulate throughout the day. Spend 10-15 minutes picking up once per day to prevent today's messes from spilling over into tomorrow.  Living in a messy home is hard on your health. If you're tired of feeling sick and stressed out due to clutter, make a change. By modifying just one habit at a time, you'll make real progress toward a cleaner home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It is common for people with addictions to have sleep disorders and for people to use substances like drugs and alcohol to treat their sleep problems, which oftentimes results in addiction. People may use drugs and alcohol to self-medicate, or to help promote sleep or wakefulness. Similarly, people in recovery from addiction experience sleep problems, which can make the recovery process difficult and symptoms may trigger relapse.According to Dr. Kima Joy Taylor, director of the Closing the Addiction Treatment Gap (CATG) initiative, only 11 percentof Americans seek treatment for addiction, leaving 20 million Americans untreated. Common signs of addiction, according to the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug dependence, include:Using drugs or alcohol longer than a person wants to or than intendedNeglecting activities because of time spent with drug and alcohol useHiding substance useHaving issues with relationshipsNeeding more of the substance because of an increased toleranceFeeling the effects of withdrawal from drugs or alcoholTaking risks to obtain alcohol or drugsShowing physical signs of not taking care of one’s selfContinuing to use substances despite the problems associated with use Source: The National Center on Addiction and Substance AbuseSymptoms of addiction include:Intense urges to useThe feeling that you need to use regularlyMaking sure you have enough of a supplyNeeding more of the substance to get the same feelingContinuing to use even though you know the consequencesSpending a lot of time getting the substanceSpending money and oftentimes more than you have on the substanceDoing things you know could cause damage to obtain the substanceFailing to stop usingGoing through withdrawal symptoms when you try to stop using In this guide, we will explore the relationship between addiction and sleep, and will discuss:How addiction can contribute to sleep loss or sleep deprivationHow feeling rested helps in recoveryTo read the rest of this article, go to ​https://mattresshelp.org/addiction-sleep/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

What follows is the framework for an Initial Visit, Middle    Visit, and Final Visit. Feeling anxious? Don't worry, the client  is more afraid of you than you are of the client! :)  What matters most  of all is the the client gets to talk and talk and talk AND be truly  heard! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial Visit Patterns\nFirst impressions really are lasting impressions. It is important to be timely and friendly.Introduction – the first 10 minutes\n\n\n\n\n\nGreet the client warmly – smile and shake hands. Escort to your office.Offer a chair and a drink of water.Your client will be nervous – not knowing what to expect. So explain to  her or him right away what she or he may be wondering about – briefly.  Your credentials, the forms that will need to be filled out, the  assurance of confidentiality, the duration of the visit, etc.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nDon’t forget to assure the client that there will be time to find out  what brings her or him in here. Given the amount of paperwork that  normally has to be filled out, she or he will begin to question the  value of this.Information Gathering – about 20 minutesAsk  the client, “So what brings you in here today?!” If the person doesn’t  know where to start, tell the client to “start anywhere.” Some clients  give coherent stories, others give a laundry list of concerns. But  generally speaking, some themes should keep coming up again and again.  Take discreet one or two word notes; you will be able to review these  shortly.A successful first visit is one in which the client has done almost all of the talking – this is all about them!Discussion / Counselor Input – about 10 minutesThis  is your opportunity to provide input. To tell the client what you think  she/he is saying and to develop a list of concerns. The client can then  be asked if what you are hearing is what she/he is saying. Ask the  client to rate the concerns from most problematic to least, and ask  which one she/he would like to work on first. You may not have all the  resources you need at hand – but you now know what you have to do some  homework on!I am a big fan of \"mapping\" as the first homework  assignment - filling out a week-long time sheet where they can write  down when the problem happens and what is going on at the time.Conclusion – about 10 minutesAssure the client that she/he can “do this.” If you honestly feel that client can't, this is a sign you need to refer.It  is crucial that the client have a printed copy of services available to  her/him – especially of warm-lines and crisis services.Make  certain the client knows that she/he can always reach you – by answering  machine and by email. That you will respond briefly, and the client can  discuss the stated concern(s) at the next meeting.End all  counseling sessions on a positive note. The client should be able to  list a few things that she/he has to look forward to over the next few  days. If the client seems to have nothing to look forward to,  this is a red flag for suicide. You will need to ask her/him, “Are you  thinking of suicide?” If she/he takes a noticeable pause before  answering or says “Maybe” or “Yes,” you need to know the protocols of  your organization for what to do when you suspect a client is suicidal.Set the next appointment time and date.End of Initial Visit  Pattern of Sessions.  Clicking on the link will take you to Sample Session One - Client Centered Counseling. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMiddle Visit Pattern\nIf the client hasn't already, remind her/him to sign in with reception.Introduction – the first 10 minutesGreet the client warmly – smile (and shake hands if hand is extended or is appropriate.) Escort to your office.Offer a chair and a drink of water.\n\n\n\n\n\nGive the client the chance to get things off her/his chest before you  move to info gathering. These concerns may be spurious – but may be  pre-occupying. Or these concerns may form the major part of this  session.Explain how this second (third, etc.) visit will look.  That you will review what happened last visit and what has happened  since then. You will continue to work on current challenges as indicated  last time – or others that may take precedent.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nNB: If the client is feeling no better or in fact feels worse, this may be out of your scope of practice. Set up a referral now. It can always be canceled.Information Gathering – about 20 minutesReview what happened last time – to make sure you are on the same page. If there was homework – review it; if the homework was not done, ask why?!Work with the primary concerns of the day.As always, try to let the client do most of the talking. If she/he is avoiding talking about concerns, bring her/him back on track.Discussion / Counselor Input – about 10 minutesThis is your opportunity to provide input. In fact you may have been already, but if you know you have reserved some time to reflect on what is being said, you will be less likely to interrupt, to talk.Note: After the initial or second session, the counselor-client interaction may become more informal and more direct. This is fine - you can be friendly and professional at the same time. But remember, you are not the client’s friend. Most professional associations do not endorse counselor-client relationships outside of the counseling setting, or any behavior – in our out of the workplace - which may violate professional boundaries.Conclusion – about 10 minutesRestate briefly what has happened and what the client is hoping to achieve – getting approval at each assertion.Again, assure the client this is “doable.” If this is beyond your scope of practice, you need to refer NOW.Homework of some kind is important The other 23 hours of this day and the rest of the days in between, you aren’t there. Becoming well is ongoing activity.NB: Check to see if the client did book or have the health assessment. If not, have her/him book it using the phone in the office.End on a positive note!Set the next appointment time and date if it has not been prebooked.End of Middle Visit Pattern of Sessions. Clicking on this link will take you to Sample Session Four - Solution Focused Counseling. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Visit Pattern\nThere is really is no such thing.  Clients often drift off after a  session or two. Also, even if you have seen the client on numerous  occasions – she or he may need to come back. This ending may be more  like a vacation break.Introduction – the first 10 minutesGreet the client warmly – smile (and shake hands if hand is extended or is appropriate.) Escort to your office.Offer a chair and a drink of water.\n\n\n\n\n\nGive the client the chance to get things off her/his chest before you  move to info gathering. These concerns may be spurious – but may be  pre-occupying. Or addressing this could take up most of this session.Explain how this “final” visit will look.

If there was homework – review it.Work with the primary concerns of the day. In a “final visit”, the client may express concern of feeling orphaned.As  always, try to let the client do most of the talking. If she/he is  avoiding talking about concerns, bring her/him back on track.Discussion / Counselor Input – about 10 minutesThis is your opportunity to provide input. Hopefully by now the client is very good at coming up with her/his own strategies.Conclusion – about 10 minutesRestate briefly what has happened over the past few weeks and what the client has achieved. Assure  the client that he or she can “do this.” It is crucial that the client  have a printed copy of services available to her/him – especially of  warm-lines and crisis services.Make certain the client knows that  she or he can always reach you somehow – for example, by email or by  sending a letter. Chances are they won’t “hound” you – but they may very  well send you a thank you note.As always, end on a positive note.  The client should leave able to easily the list the good things in her/his life.End of Final Visit  Pattern of Sessions.

CONTINUE YOUR EDUCATION too?!There  is so much useful information on every page of this website on Basic  Counseling Skills that you may want to print it off, three-hole punch  it, and put it in a large binder. This will make it easy to refer to and  add to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABOUT THIS SITE\nBasic Counseling Skills is geared to the needs of University and College Students, Health Care Practitioners, Volunteers, and New Counselors. But my hope is that EVERYONE – including Teachers and Professors, Department Managers, Volunteer Coordinators, and experienced Counselors - will find this a good refresher and will recommend it to others.This site is set up to read like a book. There are six major sections -A. Techniques, B. Theories, C. Practice, D. Self-Help, and E. Continuing Education. Each section has eight to twelve chapters.www.basic-counseling-skills.com is designed to be absolutely free. Therefore, wherever possible, when I have suggested readings or films, I have provided links to professional publications that are available on Google Books and You Tube. This site is also set up to be enjoyable. You will find each section has a pictoral theme, and at the end of each chapter or web page (other than the home page) there is an entertaining picture. These were placed there simply to reward you for reading the information to the finish! And if you click on the \"button\" at the bottom of the page, you will be returned to the top of the page you have been studying, and hopefully, practicing.I welcome your constructive suggestions.

As I got older, I noticed that my anxiety made it hard to sleep and concentrate, even if I was not in the middle of an active episode. My anxiety/panic attacks started to take control of my life, and I began missing out on family events, time with friends, and even important intimate moments within my own relationships. It took time, but I’ve learned to manage myself every day so that I am mentally ready when life begins to pile up. While I know that I need to improve continually, I think my efforts have been crucial for my mental health. Thankfully, Basic Counseling Skills has allowed me to share a few steps that I’ve taken so far to proactively prevent anxiety at its worst. I meditate. I started meditating about five years ago. I wake up each morning and give myself about half an hour devoted to just me. After reading a blog about mala beads on the May I Dwell In Gratitude blog from last December, I added mala beads to my daily meditation. I’ve started wearing them as jewelry all day, and have even learned how to make my own using hemp cord, gemstone beads, and leather tassels. They keep me centered when I need an anchor. I quit my job. Okay, I realize this sounds like it might cause more stress than not. But, hear me out. I was working a routine 9 to 5 that was actually more of a 7 to 7 thanks to being short-staffed. I was tired, I dreaded getting up, and I was even apprehensive about quitting time because I knew I wouldn’t actually leave when I was supposed to. I decided to go back to school. I’m currently working on my master’s degree in education, but I have also considered business and marketing. Until I do have my degree, I’m freelancing, much like more than one in 10 other adults. I stopped drinking. Look, I love to have a drink on a Friday night like everyone else I know, but I had to stop. Even though I was only drinking a few mixed cocktails here and there, the older I got, the more I noticed that I’d wake up with a headache and couldn’t even look at the light. I did not know this at the time, but having migraines made my hangovers even worse, something Johns Hopkins Medicine explains is likely because of the meds I take for that. I stopped drinking completely, and now I wake up every morning refreshed and ready to start the day, which has significantly reduced my stress levels on the weekend. Incidentally, I put down cigarettes as well and started eating healthier every day. I started hiking. There are proven benefits to spending time outside in nature, but I wasn’t willing to concede that all it took was a quick hike to reduce stress. I was wrong. I started hiking with friends as a way to get out of the house and get some exercise while also socializing. I soon found that simply looking at the trees, hearing the birds, and listening to the sound of rushing water did something to me. Now, I go out alone often, but I tell someone where I’m going so I don’t have to worry about getting lost or going missing (read this article by Backcountry Chronicles if you don’t understand the importance of communicating where you are). I improved my living environment.While housework isn’t always a priority for me, I tried to keep my home clean-ish. Organization was always a problem, and I finally got tired of trying to make the same overflowing drawer close. I sat down, pulled everything out of the drawer, and put it all back together in an orderly fashion. That was the spark I needed to Marie Kondo my entire house, and turn it into my healthy sanctuary. I cleaned and decluttered, then added some of my favorite nature scenes, and even a few plants. Am I an expert in mental health? No, far from it. But, what I know is that making both minor and drastic changes to my lifestyle has helped me squash stress in my daily life. This has led to fewer panic attacks and a better understanding of what triggers them from me. These may not work for everyone, but I hope that my experiences will inspire others to take a look at their own life and eliminate stressors that can make that life less enjoyable. Visit Basic Counseling Skills for free and useful information on counseling techniques, theories, and practices! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

As I got older, I noticed that my anxiety made it hard to sleep and concentrate, even if I was not in the middle of an active episode. My anxiety/panic attacks started to take",
            " control of my life, and I began missing out on family events, time with friends, and even important intimate moments within my own relationships. It took time, but I’ve learned to manage myself every day so that I am mentally ready when life begins to pile up. While I know that I need to improve continually, I think my efforts have been crucial for my mental health. Thankfully, Basic Counseling Skills has allowed me to share a few steps that I’ve taken so far to proactively prevent anxiety at i",
            "ts worst. I meditate. I started meditating about five years ago. I wake up each morning and give myself about half an hour devoted to just me. After reading a blog about mala beads on the May I Dwell In Gratitude blog from last December, I added mala beads to my daily meditation. I’ve started wearing them as jewelry all day, and have even learned how to make my own using hemp cord, gemstone beads, and leather tassels. They keep me centered when I need an anchor. I quit my job. Okay, I realize th",
            "is sounds like it might cause more stress than not. But, hear me out. I was working a routine 9 to 5 that was actually more of a 7 to 7 thanks to being short-staffed. I was tired, I dreaded getting up, and I was even apprehensive about quitting time because I knew I wouldn’t actually leave when I was supposed to. I decided to go back to school. I’m currently working on my master’s degree in education, but I have also considered business and marketing. Until I do have my degree, I’m freelancing, ",
            "much like more than one in 10 other adults. I stopped drinking. Look, I love to have a drink on a Friday night like everyone else I know, but I had to stop. Even though I was only drinking a few mixed cocktails here and there, the older I got, the more I noticed that I’d wake up with a headache and couldn’t even look at the light. I did not know this at the time, but having migraines made my hangovers even worse, something Johns Hopkins Medicine explains is likely because of the meds I take for ",
            "that. I stopped drinking completely, and now I wake up every morning refreshed and ready to start the day, which has significantly reduced my stress levels on the weekend. Incidentally, I put down cigarettes as well and started eating healthier every day. I started hiking. There are proven benefits to spending time outside in nature, but I wasn’t willing to concede that all it took was a quick hike to reduce stress. I was wrong. I started hiking with friends as a way to get out of the house and ",

Now, I go out alone often, but I tell someone where I’m going so I don’t have to worry about getting lost or going missing (read this article by Backcountry Chronicles if you don’t understand the importance of communicating where you are). I improved my living environment.While housework isn’t always a priority for me, I trie",

I sat down, pulled everything out of the drawer, and put it all back together in an orderly fashion. That was the spark I needed to Marie Kondo my entire house, and turn it into my healthy sanctuary. I cleaned and decluttered, then added some of my favorite nature scenes, and even a few plants. Am I an expert in mental health? No, far from it. But, what I k",
            "now is that making both minor and drastic changes to my lifestyle has helped me squash stress in my daily life. This has led to fewer panic attacks and a better understanding of what triggers them from me. These may not work for everyone, but I hope that my experiences will inspire others to take a look at their own life and eliminate stressors that can make that life less enjoyable. Visit Basic Counseling Skills for free and useful information on counseling techniques, theories, and practices! ",

If you are having a midlife crisis, the good news is that you can still find inspiration while coping with your realization that you are aging. Use these five tips from Basic Counseling Skills to make it easier to cope with your midlife crisis. Adopt Healthy HabitsIf you are concerned about the quality of your life, start adopting a healthier lifestyle. You'll see more sustainable change if you adopt small habits instead of making a complete overhaul. Start eating a healthy diet and making time to exercise and see how these two changes benefit your mindset. Lean On Your Loved OnesYou may be tempted to pull away from friends and family members while you go through a midlife crisis, but now is the perfect time to lean into your relationships. Schedule regular date nights with your significant other and make time for lunch with your friends each week. Spending time with the people you love will help you feel more positive about your life. Change CareersIf you aren't happy with your current career path and have always dreamed of launching your own company, now is the perfect time to take control of your job. Starting a business is a lot of work, but it can be a rewarding endeavor if you have a dynamic service or product. One of the hardest parts of opening a business is developing a good marketing campaign. Start by designing a logo that makes your brand instantly recognizable to its customers. There are many convenient logo makers available online. Just choose a template and customize it with your own icon, text, and slogan. Get More Fresh AirFresh air is a great mood booster. If you spend more time outdoors, you may have a better frame of mind regarding your life. One way you can get more fresh air is by increasing your exercise. Go for a daily walk or spend a few hours each week at a local pool. You can also spend time relaxing in your backyard to reap the many benefits of fresh air without exerting a lot of effort. Pursue Your DreamsIf you have big dreams but have never made the time to pursue them in the past, now is the perfect time to turn your dreams into a reality. For example, if you have always wanted to become a published author but have never sat down to draft a manuscript, start putting pen to paper so that you can make your dream come true.

This theory, which is widely used by counselors across the globe, states that most people who undergo loss of a loved one go through various stages (non-chronologically), sometimes spending more time in one stage or repeating stages cyclically. These stages are denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. Despite initially being defined to apply to grief therapy, these stages are actually applicable to all losses – including the temporary loss of function that can occur when an athlete is overcoming a sports injury such as a tendon or muscle tear.Why Is Injury Sometimes Similar To Death?When you are as passionate about sport as a professional or semi-professional athlete is, being unable to train can be psychologically challenging for many reasons. A 2018 study by researchers at the University of Adelaide found that suddenly stopping exercise can result in increased symptoms of depression. Exercise, after all, has powerful mental health benefits, with many studies showing it can help battle depression and anxiety. For pro athletes, a gap in their training schedule can be even more catastrophic, since it can interfere with goals – for instance, an upcoming competition that is crucial for the advancement of their career. Athletes should be introduced to the different stages, and they should also understand that these stages are not linear (and that they do not necessarily have time limits).Taking It Step By StepAthletes who have had an injury will usually be recommended to rest for a specific amount of time. After this period is over, they will usually be given rehabilitation exercises to complete, which are less strenuous and more narrowly focused than their habitual training routine. In lieu of heavy weights, they may be told to complete exercises with gymnastic rings, which are good for strengthening the core and reducing spine stiffness, as well as the strengthening of the latissimus dorsi (upper body) muscles. These exercises rely on body weight to create resistance. If your client is frustrated because their workout has changed, you can use cognitive-behavioral therapy and other therapies to encourage them to make a mental shift. This in turn will help them stick to their new routine and hopefully achieve faster recovery.Training The MindIn addition to working out their body, athletes in recovery should also rely on natural yet powerful techniques such as mindfulness meditation, yoga, and controlled breathing to keep their mind ‘in the here and now’ – especially when anxiety about their sporting future starts to take hold. A 2018 study by researchers at the University of Kent showed that athletes in the process of sport rehabilitation can benefit from mindfulness training – which helps improve pain tolerance and awareness.​If you are counseling an athlete who is recovering from a sports injury, enlightening them on the different stages of grief – and discussing how these stages may apply to them – can help improve awareness and acceptance. Using CBT and other skills, patients can be instructed to take their rehabilitation one step at a time, with a focus on smaller, then larger goals. Mind training can also be relied upon to help boost mental strength and improve pain tolerance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Dolan) focuses on what clients want to    achieve through therapy, rather than on the problem(s) that made them    seek help. The approach does not focus on the past, but instead focuses  on the present and future. The counselor asks the client to envision  their preferred future and then, working with the counselor, the client  starts to work toward achieve this goal(s).*****“Founders”: Steve de Shazer and Insoo BergProblem talk creates problems. Solution talk creates solutions. - Steve de Shazer (1940-2005)Whether  we admit it or not, pre-assumptions we have about our clients are  spilled over in our interactions with clients in a subtle and not so  subtle manner. - Insoo Kim Berg (1935-2007)*****In  Solution Focused or Brief Therapy, the counselor and client may work on  specific challenges such as improving a grade in a particular course or  may set goals for many components in the client’s life. For example, in  taking or reviewing a whole health inventory, the client may be asked  where she or he would like to be in these areas and the strategies he/he  has about how to achieve these goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechniques\nLooking for previous solutionsSF counselors have  learned that most people have previously solved many problems and  probably have some ideas of how to solve the current problem. To help  clients see these potential solutions they may ask, \"What did you (or  others) do that was helpful in the past?\"Present and future-focused questions vs. past-oriented focusThe  questions asked by SF counselors are usually focused on the present or  on the future. This reflects the basic belief that problems are best  solved by focusing on what is already working, and how a client would  like their life to be, rather than focusing on the past and what isn’t  wanted. For example, they may ask, \"What will you be doing in the next  week that would indicate to you and other that you are continuing to  make progress?\"ComplimentsValidating what clients  are already doing well, and acknowledging how difficult their problems  are encourages the client to change while giving the message that the  counselor has been listening and cares. In SF therapy, compliments are  often conveyed in the form of appreciatively toned questions of “How did  you do that?” that invite the client to self-compliment by virtue of  answering the question. Inviting the clients to do more of what is working.SF  counselors invite the client to do more of what has previously worked,  or to try changes they have brought up which they would like to try –  frequently called \"an experiment.\" As Dr Phil puts it, \"How’s that  working for you?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Miracle Question  \n\nA key part of Solution Focused Therapy is the “Miracle Question”.  It goes like so:\"Suppose  our meeting is over, you go home, do whatever you planned to do for the  rest of the day. And then, some time in the evening, you get tired and  go to sleep. And in the middle of the night, when you are fast asleep, a  miracle happens and all the problems that brought you here today are  solved just like that. But since the miracle happened over night nobody  is telling you that the miracle happened. When you wake up the next  morning, how are you going to start discovering that the miracle  happened? ... What else are you going to notice? What else?\" \n\nGoals \nGoals must be stated positively and in a way that progress can be  noted.  If a client wants to lose weight, he would say “I want to  achieve a normal weight which means I need to lose 20 pounds. I will do  this by following the National Food Guide and exercising 30 minutes  daily.” vs. “I don’t want to be fat.”  Let’s say a person wants  to get out of poverty. What is the five year plan, four year plan … one  week plan in order to start to realize this goal.As with  strengths based therapy, the client is helped to identify their skills  and resources. Skills may be internal resources like determination,  belief, past experiences and intelligence.  Resources can include  external ones such as partners, family, friends, and support groups.\nSample Session \nIn our Sample Session Seven - Solution Focused - Mary knows what she  wants but doesn't know how to get there. Ideally, Mary would come up  with solutions on her own, using her skills and her own resources. In  this situation, Mary used her personal quality of stick-to-it-ness and  her primary resource was Joan herself.One criticism of this  session is that Joan was steering. In theory Joan should have worked  with Mary to lay the smorgasbord of ideas out and Mary would have made  the best choice. In practice, however, if a counselor is aware of an  option that works (and that others aren't working), why would she not  encourage the client to at least explore a good thing? \n\n\n\nFurther Reading and Video\nBooks   \"Solution-Focused Brief Therapy: Its Effective Use in Agency Settings\"  by Teri Pichot (Author), Yvonne M.

Dolan) focuses on what clients want to    achieve through therapy, rather than",
            " on the problem(s) that made them    seek help. The approach does not focus on the past, but instead focuses  on the present and future. The counselor asks the client to envision  their preferred future and then, working with the counselor, the client  starts to work toward achieve this goal(s).*****“Founders”: Steve de Shazer and Insoo BergProblem talk creates problems. Solution talk creates solutions. - Steve de Shazer (1940-2005)Whether  we admit it or not, pre-assumptions we have about our c",
            "lients are  spilled over in our interactions with clients in a subtle and not so  subtle manner. - Insoo Kim Berg (1935-2007)*****In  Solution Focused or Brief Therapy, the counselor and client may work on  specific challenges such as improving a grade in a particular course or  may set goals for many components in the client’s life. For example, in  taking or reviewing a whole health inventory, the client may be asked  where she or he would like to be in these areas and the strategies he/he  ha",
            "s about how to achieve these goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechniques\nLooking for previous solutionsSF counselors have  learned that most people have previously solved many problems and  probably have some ideas of how to solve the current problem. To help  clients see these potential solutions they may ask, \"What did you (or  others) do that was helpful in the past?\"Present and future-focused questions vs. past-oriented focusThe  questions asked by SF counselors are usually focused on the present or  on the",
            " future. This reflects the basic belief that problems are best  solved by focusing on what is already working, and how a client would  like their life to be, rather than focusing on the past and what isn’t  wanted. For example, they may ask, \"What will you be doing in the next  week that would indicate to you and other that you are continuing to  make progress?\"ComplimentsValidating what clients  are already doing well, and acknowledging how difficult their problems  are encourages the client to",
            " change while giving the message that the  counselor has been listening and cares. In SF therapy, compliments are  often conveyed in the form of appreciatively toned questions of “How did  you do that?” that invite the client to self-compliment by virtue of  answering the question. Inviting the clients to do more of what is working.SF  counselors invite the client to do more of what has previously worked,  or to try changes they have brought up which they would like to try –  frequently called \"",
            "an experiment.\" As Dr Phil puts it, \"How’s that  working for you?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Miracle Question  \n\nA key part of Solution Focused Therapy is the “Miracle Question”.  It goes like so:\"Suppose  our meeting is over, you go home, do whatever you planned to do for the  rest of the day. And then, some time in the evening, you get tired and  go to sleep. And in the middle of the night, when you are fast asleep, a  miracle happens and all the problems that brought you here today are  solved just like t",
            "hat. But since the miracle happened over night nobody  is telling you that the miracle happened. When you wake up the next  morning, how are you going to start discovering that the miracle  happened? ... What else are you going to notice? What else?\" \n\nGoals \nGoals must be stated positively and in a way that progress can be  noted.  If a client wants to lose weight, he would say “I want to  achieve a normal weight which means I need to lose 20 pounds. I will do  this by following the National Fo",
            "od Guide and exercising 30 minutes  daily.” vs. “I don’t want to be fat.”  Let’s say a person wants  to get out of poverty. What is the five year plan, four year plan … one  week plan in order to start to realize this goal.As with  strengths based therapy, the client is helped to identify their skills  and resources. Skills may be internal resources like determination,  belief, past experiences and intelligence.  Resources can include  external ones such as partners, family, friends, and support",
            " groups.\nSample Session \nIn our Sample Session Seven - Solution Focused - Mary knows what she  wants but doesn't know how to get there. Ideally, Mary would come up  with solutions on her own, using her skills and her own resources. In  this situation, Mary used her personal quality of stick-to-it-ness and  her primary resource was Joan herself.One criticism of this  session is that Joan was steering. In theory Joan should have worked  with Mary to lay the smorgasbord of ideas out and Mary would ",
            "have made  the best choice. In practice, however, if a counselor is aware of an  option that works (and that others aren't working), why would she not  encourage the client to at least explore a good thing? \n\n\n\nFurther Reading and Video\nBooks   \"Solution-Focused Brief Therapy: Its Effective Use in Agency Settings\"  by Teri Pichot (Author), Yvonne M.

From visiting family to going on vacation, flying is entirely normalized and helpfully accessible, in terms of getting where you want or need to go. However, for some, flying can be a nightmare — even to the point that trips are missed because of the stress and anxiety that the fear can bring. If you or someone you know has a fear of flying, you can be sure to conquer that fear in no time at all with some simple techniques.Know the facts  Also known as aviophobia, the fear of flying certainly isn’t unheard of. In fact, it’s estimated that 6.5% of the population has it, which accounts for roughly 20 million people. With that said, one of the best ways to begin facing your fear of flying is to get comfortable with the idea by learning the facts. For instance, if you’re worried about a plane crash, knowing that the possibility of that happening is extremely low can help you be more comfortable during take-off. After all, flying is considered to be much safer than driving! Becoming knowledgeable about how a plane works and all of the security measures in place to keep you safe can also help you lessen your fears. Of course, even with all the facts, a fear of flying can still get in the way of air travel, which is where other methods such as exposure therapy might be able to help. Managing the symptomsFor many people, the fear of flying can mean many things . For instance, maybe you don’t fear that something will go wrong, but you have a fear of heights that makes you also fear flying in a plane. In any situation, conquering the fear of flying can often begin with managing the individual symptoms. For example, bringing along medication or using acupressure can help to prevent the nausea that a child might experience during the flight, and learning some breathing techniques may help to manage your anxiety. Speaking to a professional can be another great way of getting your fear under control though managing the symptoms of your fear. Whether that includes learning meditative techniques for managing your stress before a trip, or simply talking about how you feel, you can gain the tools necessary to make that journey you’ve been wanting to take.Exposure to flying For some, exposure to flying may aid in conquering the fear of flying. The idea is that going somewhere, even if it’s just an hour-long flight, can help you get used to what flying feels like, what to expect, and what the process is like (when it comes to ascending, descending, and boarding). And, if getting on a plane to make a short journey still seems like too much to bear, virtual reality exposure can bring about a whole new perspective by presenting someone with their fears via a headset. This makes for an immersive experience without actually boarding a plane in reality. Another interesting way to conquer the fear of flying through exposure is through workshops or classes, which can include working on a number of techniques to come to terms with flying. From question and answer sessions with trained pilots to working your way up to an actual flight, taking a class or attending a workshop can be a great way to get the stress, anxiety, and nerves under control — and a step in the right direction to getting more comfortable with flying.In today’s society, flying is one of the most convenient ways to travel. However, for those who have a fear of flying, even an hour-long plane journey can feel unbearable. With that said, many find relief in knowing the facts, such as how safe flying really is, while others prefer to manage the symptoms or try exposure to flying. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

However, for some, flying can be a nightmare — even to the point that trips are missed because of the stress and anxiety that the fear can bring. If you or someone you know has a fear of flying, you can be sure to conquer that fear in no time at all with some simple techniques.Know the facts  Also known as aviophobia, the fear of flying certainly isn’t unheard of. In fact, it’s estimated that 6.5% of the population has it, which accoun",

For instance, if you’re worried about a plane crash, knowing that the possibility of that happening is extremely low can help you be more comfortable during take-off. After all, flying is considered to be much safer than driving! Becoming knowledgeable about how a plane works and all of the security measures in place to keep you saf",

Of course, even with all the facts, a fear of flying can still get in the way of air travel, which is where other methods such as exposure therapy might be able to help. Managing the symptomsFor many people, the fear of flying can mean many things . For instance, maybe you don’t fear that something will go wrong, but you have a fear of heights that makes you also fear flying in a plane.

For example, bringing along medication or using acupressure can help to prevent the nausea that a child might experience during the flight, and learning some breathing techniques may help to manage your anxiety.

The idea is that going somewhere, even if it’s just an hour-long flight, can help you get used to what flying feels like, what to expect, and what the process is like (when it comes to ascending, descending, and boarding). And, if getting on a plane to make a short journey still seems like too much to bear, virtual realit",
            "y exposure can bring about a whole new perspective by presenting someone with their fears via a headset. This makes for an immersive experience without actually boarding a plane in reality. Another interesting way to conquer the fear of flying through exposure is through workshops or classes, which can include working on a number of techniques to come to terms with flying. From question and answer sessions with trained pilots to working your way up to an actual flight, taking a class or attendin",

But sometimes, your mind may feel a little foggy, which may make it harder for you to concentrate on even the most basic tasks. This can be a frustrating thing to deal with, yet there are a few mental clarity counseling techniques you can use to help lessen this frustration.What is Mental Clarity Counseling?Mental clarity counseling aims to help you pull yourself out of life’s doldrums by helping to keep your brain focused and sharp. In some cases, these “doldrums” could present themselves in conditions typically tagged as sad, bored, or overwhelmed. These can lead to feelings of depression or anxiety, which could create increasingly unhealthy situations over time.This form of counseling can also help you pinpoint where this brain fog may originate. Some of these origin points could be related to emotional shock, PTSD, or unprocessed past trauma. A counseling session may unpack these things, which may ultimately lead to better overall mental health.Fog-Clearing TacticsThere are a few tactics that a counselor can deploy to combat foggy brain, including several that aren’t in the psychological range per se. For instance, your diet could be a heavy influence on how often your brain fills with that foggy feeling, as It’s been shown that a lack of specific vitamins can correlate to a downturn in brain functionality. A counselor’s recommended dietary changes may work wonders in keeping clarity consistent.Your counselor could also recommend an exercise regiment as a way to clear the brain. Just 20 minutes of exercise three times a week is enough to clear the head and retain focus. The reason for this is because it forces the brain to work in a heightened state of homeostasis, which could increase mental efficiency and lessen mental stagnation.Of course, there’s also no substitute for therapeutic discussion. Counselors can gently work with you to uncover things in your life that cause your brain to feel like it’s in a haze. Once discovered, counselors can teach you how to deploy coping mechanisms that can keep the fog at bay.​Ultimately, the fog-busting techniques deployed by mental clarity counselors can do more than clear your head. They can bring your mind – and you – to a happier, healthier place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This can be a frustrating thing to deal with, yet there are a few mental clarity counseling techniques you can use to help lessen this frustration.What is Mental Clarity Counseling?Mental clarity counseling aims to help you pull yourself out of life’s doldrums by helping to keep your brain focused and sharp. In some cases, these “doldrums” could present themselves in conditions typically tag",
            "ged as sad, bored, or overwhelmed. These can lead to feelings of depression or anxiety, which could create increasingly unhealthy situations over time.This form of counseling can also help you pinpoint where this brain fog may originate. Some of these origin points could be related to emotional shock, PTSD, or unprocessed past trauma. A counseling session may unpack these things, which may ultimately lead to better overall mental health.Fog-Clearing TacticsThere are a few tactics that a counselo",
            "r can deploy to combat foggy brain, including several that aren’t in the psychological range per se. For instance, your diet could be a heavy influence on how often your brain fills with that foggy feeling, as It’s been shown that a lack of specific vitamins can correlate to a downturn in brain functionality. A counselor’s recommended dietary changes may work wonders in keeping clarity consistent.Your counselor could also recommend an exercise regiment as a way to clear the brain. Just 20 minute",
            "s of exercise three times a week is enough to clear the head and retain focus. The reason for this is because it forces the brain to work in a heightened state of homeostasis, which could increase mental efficiency and lessen mental stagnation.Of course, there’s also no substitute for therapeutic discussion. Counselors can gently work with you to uncover things in your life that cause your brain to feel like it’s in a haze. Once discovered, counselors can teach you how to deploy coping mechanism",

There are a variety of counseling theories and this website does not  to  pretend to list them all or to provide expert information.The theories to be reviewed include Client Centered (Carl Rogers),  Holistic Health (Biopsychosocial), Strengths Based (Positive Thinking /  Learned Optimism), Cognitive Behavioral (ABC Model), Solution Focused  (Where do I really want to be?!) and Existential (Why am I here?!) In addition I will provide a section on Becoming Unnecessary / Learning to Let Go (Closure.)The small pictures in this Section include a picture of the Founders of various theories, along with people in helping relationships. The end pics featuring children are a reminder that: Our children are our only hope for the future, but we are their only hope for their present and their future. - Zig Ziglar  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction to Counseling Theories\nIn Client Centered (Rogerian)  counseling, the counselor  provides the growth-promoting climate and the client is then free and  able to discover and grow as she / he wants and needs to. Prevailing  characteristics of the session are active listening, empathy, acceptance  (unconditional positive regard) and genuineness.Holistic Health (Biopsychosocial)   asserts that we have physical, intellectual, social, emotional,  vocational and spiritual needs -- the neglect of which reduces the  ability of one to withstand the effects of stress. And we live in  socio-economic conditions that can enhance or demean our long-term  well-being.  Strengths Based counseling focuses on what is going right in a  person’s life. The counselor and client work together to find past and  present successes and use these to address current and future  challenges. Its first cousin, Positive Thinking or Learned Optimism, is about learning a positive perspective – focusing on what can go right.\n\n\n\n\n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy (ABC Method)  could be described as “as I think, so I feel (and do)!” In any given situation you have:A.\tActivating Event – the actual event and the client’s immediate interpretations of the eventB.\tBeliefs about the event – this evaluation can be rational or irrationalC.\tConsequences – how you feel and what you do or other thoughts\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSolution Focused Therapy (Where do I want to be?!)  focuses on  what clients want to achieve through therapy rather than on the  problem(s) that made them seek help. The approach does not focus on the  past, but instead, focuses on the present and future. The client is  asked to envision how the future will be different when the problem is  no longer present.The Existential approach (Why Am I Here?!)   is also known as “Meaning Therapy.” As Viktor Frankyl put it, “He who  knows the ‘why’ for his existence, will be able to bear almost any  ‘how.’” Therapy is concerned with creating one’s identity and  establishing meaningful relationships with others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning to Let Go / Becoming Unnecessary\nIt can be difficult for counselors to “let go” of their clients, to  “become unnecessary.” Certain clients are a pleasure for counselors to  work with – but while we are friendly with each other, we are never  friends.

Sadly, many people fail to address their mental health needs. But it’s just as important as exercising your body and getting into shape. Some would argue it’s even more important. So, what can you do to ensure a healthy state of mind? In this guide from Basic Counseling Skills, you will learn some effective tips that you can implement right away to start benefiting from better mental health. 1. Change CareersIf your current career only serves to stress you out and drag you down, it might be time to pursue other avenues. It doesn’t matter how old you are or how long you’ve been at your present job. It’s never too late to make a career change. The only thing stopping you is you. If you’re interested in changing careers, online schooling is a great place to start. Many people are pursuing an online degree these days, but it’s important to make sure that the school you’re looking at is accredited and offers competitive tuition rates. By taking advantage of an online program, you can still have time to hold down a job and spend time with your family. Online schools afford you lots of flexibility, so you can tend to your daily responsibilities while you earn your master’s. 2. Go to a Sporting EventThere’s nothing quite like watching sports live. You can find discounted ticket prices for the Dodgers online. Filter the results you want by date, seating rating, price, and more. You can even find interactive seating charts of Yankee Stadium to get a 360-degree virtual view of the seats before you buy. 3. Diet and ExerciseExercise and diet are important to your health. They can help you lose weight, improve your mood, and boost your energy levels. But did you also know that they can greatly improve your mental health, as well? A healthy diet and exercise can improve your mood, help you think more clearly, and combat depression. 4. CounselingMental health is something that we all need to work on. Mental health is the degree of psychological well-being or mental illness, and it’s something we can all improve with a little help. Counseling offers a safe space for you to express your thoughts, fears, and worries while receiving the help of an expert. 5. Create a Self-Care RoutineOne of the best ways to improve your mental health is to create a self-care routine. It’s important to take care of yourself and make sure you’re doing the things that keep you happy, healthy, and stress-free. 6. Try New Hobbies Like Gardening, Photography, or PaintingFinding hobbies to do outside of work is a great way to change up your routine and improve your mental health. Some examples are gardening, photography, or painting. 7. Hone Your Skills at Something You Already Enjoy DoingIf you are looking for a new hobby, why not choose one that will help improve your mental health too? Find an activity that is fun and challenging. As you get better at the activity, you will feel better about yourself. 8. Join a Club or Group That Interests YouWhen you join a club that interests you, not only are you getting involved in something that’s important to you, but you’re also opening yourself up to new people. Being surrounded by like-minded people and engaging in activities that interest you can lead to an increased sense of belonging.Image via Pexels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Sadly, many people fail to address their mental health needs. But it’s just as important as exercising your body and getting",
            " into shape. Some would argue it’s even more important. So, what can you do to ensure a healthy state of mind? In this guide from Basic Counseling Skills, you will learn some effective tips that you can implement right away to start benefiting from better mental health. 1. Change CareersIf your current career only serves to stress you out and drag you down, it might be time to pursue other avenues. It doesn’t matter how old you are or how long you’ve been at your present job. It’s never too late",
            " to make a career change. The only thing stopping you is you. If you’re interested in changing careers, online schooling is a great place to start. Many people are pursuing an online degree these days, but it’s important to make sure that the school you’re looking at is accredited and offers competitive tuition rates. By taking advantage of an online program, you can still have time to hold down a job and spend time with your family. Online schools afford you lots of flexibility, so you can tend",
            " to your daily responsibilities while you earn your master’s. 2. Go to a Sporting EventThere’s nothing quite like watching sports live. You can find discounted ticket prices for the Dodgers online. Filter the results you want by date, seating rating, price, and more. You can even find interactive seating charts of Yankee Stadium to get a 360-degree virtual view of the seats before you buy. 3. Diet and ExerciseExercise and diet are important to your health. They can help you lose weight, improve ",
            "your mood, and boost your energy levels. But did you also know that they can greatly improve your mental health, as well? A healthy diet and exercise can improve your mood, help you think more clearly, and combat depression. 4. CounselingMental health is something that we all need to work on. Mental health is the degree of psychological well-being or mental illness, and it’s something we can all improve with a little help. Counseling offers a safe space for you to express your thoughts, fears, a",
            "nd worries while receiving the help of an expert. 5. Create a Self-Care RoutineOne of the best ways to improve your mental health is to create a self-care routine. It’s important to take care of yourself and make sure you’re doing the things that keep you happy, healthy, and stress-free. 6. Try New Hobbies Like Gardening, Photography, or PaintingFinding hobbies to do outside of work is a great way to change up your routine and improve your mental health. Some examples are gardening, photography,",
            " or painting. 7. Hone Your Skills at Something You Already Enjoy DoingIf you are looking for a new hobby, why not choose one that will help improve your mental health too? Find an activity that is fun and challenging. As you get better at the activity, you will feel better about yourself. 8. Join a Club or Group That Interests YouWhen you join a club that interests you, not only are you getting involved in something that’s important to you, but you’re also opening yourself up to new people.

Example of more complex sample sessions are available elsewhere but are beyond the scope of student, volunteer and new counselors. (This link is to The Mental Health Desk Reference: Visual Guides and More for Learning to Use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual edited by Carlton E. Munson.)\n\n\nWhat is most important of all in your practice is that you are there  and you care. You listen with empathy, acceptance and genuineness.You  create the nurturing environment (and sometimes get the information or  resources for them that they might not know about or have access to) and  tra-da! A difficult corner in the road of life will have been rounded.Since  you are a student, volunteer or “general practice” counselor, if your  client needs more than this, you may need to refer. My family doctor  once said to me – and I treasure her wisdom:“If you refer and the referral was not necessary, people will forgive  you. But if you don’t refer and the referral WAS necessary …”Well, you get the picture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are now going to get to be a \"fly-on-the-wall\" in a series of  sample sessions. Counselor Joan is in her mid-fifties, works in Student  Services at a college, and has an \"eclectic\" approach to counseling -  using the theories and techniques most appropriate for her client in any  given meeting. Mary is a third year college student who is  feeling depressed and anxious and has \"relationship issues\" - the most  common reasons for seeking help. She has never had counseling before and  is not quite sure what to expect. This is a fabricated series and any resemblance to actual people or events is coincidental and unintended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground \nMary has felt “down” and \"testy\" for some time. She saw a student  services poster in the women’s bathroom and decided to give them a call.  At this center the reception only asks:1.\tIf the person is a college student or alumnus2.\tName3.\tPhone and email4.\tCounselor preference – gender, language, etc.*****To see how things are going, click on the following SAMPLE SESSIONS buttons on the left hand side.1 - Client Centered (Carl Rogers)2 & 3 - A \"No Show\" and a Cancellation (It happens!)4 - Strength Based (Positive Thinking / Learned Optimism)5 - Cognitive Behavioral (ABC Method)6 - Holistic Health (Biopsychosocial Model)7 - Solution Focussed (Where do I want to be?!)8 - Existential (What am I here?!)9 - Becoming Unnecessary (Learning to Let Go)\n\n\n\nStill feeling a little anxious?  Maybe you need to watch \"The Worst Counseling Session Ever!\" :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48wzZww2RUk&feature=related \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake yourself a good person, then you can be certain there is at least one less bad dog in the world. - Unknown \n\n\n\n\nBuy  at AllPosters.com\n\n\n\n\nTake me to the top of the page!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

When the time comes to start considering your options for assisted living, it’s easy to become overwhelmed by the sheer number of housing options. Not only are there different categories of assisted living to choose from, there are also a plethora of homes from which to choose. The right choice depends on a number of factors, including support needs, expense, and personal preference.Once a home is chosen, there’s still a significant barrier to overcome: figuring out how to pay for it. There are a number of different options, but it’s important to choose the option that will allow for comfortable living now, while also ensuring your resources aren’t used up too quickly.This guide helps those searching for assisted living homes overcome the two main barriers: choosing a home and figuring out how to pay for it. In this guide, you will learn about the different types of assisted living homes, how to choose the right home for you, how to pay for that home, and state-specific resources to assist you in your search.Care Options for Seniors and People With DisabilitiesThere are three levels of assisted living: assisted living communities, independent living communities, and home care. Home care brings assistance with daily living to the home, independent living offers a community with convenient amenities, and assisted living combines a community that offers convenient amenities with support for daily living tasks.Assisted LivingAssisted living is a residential community for people who need help with everyday activities, such as bathing and dressing. Since residents usually live in their own private or semi-private apartments, these communities are able to offer a supportive atmosphere that is still independent. Residents can typically tailor the support services to match their needs, so they can perform more of less of their own daily tasks according to their current abilities.Who it’s for: Assisted living communities are a good choice for seniors and people with physical disabilities who need help with tasks such as bathing, dressing, eating, taking medications, and using the restroom.Who it’s not for: Assisted living is not a good choice for people who are still able to live independently, as the unneeded services may result in a higher cost than independent living facilities. However, it can still be a good choice for those who are mostly independent now, but will need support for daily living in the not-too-distant future, since many have programs and services designed to help seniors transition from a low level of care to a more comprehensive care plan.What’s available: Assisted living communities are similar to independent living communities, with services including meals, transportation, and social activities. However, assisted living communities also have support services for activities of daily life, including hygiene, fall prevention, and housekeeping. Often, assisted living communities provide additional medical care as residents’ needs increase as they age. Some contract with local health care providers that can come in to offer medical care as needs increase.What it costs: According to the Genworth 2017 Cost of Care Survey, you can expect assisted living to cost about $3,750 per month.Independent LivingIndependent living offers a home or apartment in a community designed for seniors and people with disabilities. Residents live in private apartments or homes with access to common areas. It offers convenience and a low-maintenance lifestyle, but does not have the same level of support as assisted living.Who it’s for: Typically, people who choose independent living are able to live on their own, but prefer the convenience of having services available to minimize their daily tasks. Independent living is a good choice for seniors and people with disabilities who do not need assistance with daily living and want to join a community with social and entertainment opportunities.Who it’s not for: Since independent living does not offer full time health care or help with daily living activities such as bathing, dressing, eating, or taking medication, it’s not a good choice for people who need these support services, or those who may need them in the near future.What’s available: In an independent living community, residents get convenient access to services that are designed to minimize daily responsibilities, such as laundry, housekeeping, on-site dining, transportation, and security. Activities, events, and entertainment are typically available with the community. Amenities may include on-site gyms, beauty salons, and pools. Some have periodic access to medical care, but independent living communities typically do not have full time staff dedicated to medical care.What it costs: The cost of independent living is typically either similar to, or slightly more than, the local cost of similar housing options, such as an apartment or townhome that’s not in an independent living community. Generally, independent living costs between $1,500 to $3,500 a month for a one-bedroom apartment.Home CareHome care is in-home personal and medical support for people with disabilities or who are otherwise unable to manage the tasks of daily life. With home care, individuals can age in place in a private, comfortable environment with which they are familiar. While this type of assisted living offers independence and the ability to control schedules and routines, it may be cost prohibitive, and care may not be available around the clock.Who it’s for: Home care is a good option for seniors or people with disabilities who have been recently hospitalized and are healing at home. This service can help these individuals transition back to independence. Home care can also be a good choice for individuals who have experienced a decline in function and are unable to manage the tasks of daily life independently, but prefer to stay at home.Who it’s not for: Home care is not optimal for those who need care around the clock. It’s also not a great long-term option for those without significant income or savings.What’s available: Home care services include both personal and medical support. The personal services offered typically include hygiene, home chores, and other assistance, such as:BathingGetting dressedAppointment escortingMeal preparation and deliveryHousekeepingLaundryFall prevention (including assistance in moving) Those who need medical care typically have access to services such as:Wound careInjections or administration of important medicationsManaging illness and chronic conditionsMonitoring vitals such as blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, and breathingAssistance with taking the correct medications on time What it costs: According to the Genworth 2017 Cost of Care Survey, homemaker services cost about $3,994 per month, and a home health aide costs about $4,099 monthly.Financial Support OptionsLong-term care can be expensive, and cost is one the main challenges to overcome. Although some families are able to pay out of pocket for residential and care expenses, many are not able to afford it on their own. For those individuals, there are financial support options including Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and HUD programs.MedicaidMedicaid offers health coverage for some low-income families, including the elderly and people with disabilities. You may qualify for Medicaid based on your income and family size.Although state Medicaid programs vary, residents with Medicaid will have at least some assisted living costs covered in most states. Some states use different terms to refer to assisted living coverage, such as residential care, adult foster care, personal care homes, or supported living. Home health services are one of the mandatory benefits available for those with Medicaid.Coverage varies depending on the state, and may include medication administration, chores, homemaker services, and recreational activities. Medicaid does not pay for room and board in any state. However, it may cover meal preparation and serving, just not the cost of food itself.MedicareMedicare is a national health insurance program generally available to seniors 65 and older, or younger people with disabilities or permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant.Home health services are typically covered by Medicare for those who are eligible. To become eligible, a doctor must certify that you are homebound, or that you need intermittent skilled nursing care, specific physical therapy, speech-language pathology, or continued occupational therapy services.Medicare does not cover long term care such as assisted living, 24-hour care, meal deliveries, homemaker services like laundry, or personal care like bathing or dressing.Social Security offers financial benefits for people who are disabled, or those who are 62 or older. Along with retirement income for seniors, Social Security provides two other means of financial support. The first is Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which is available for people with limited income and assets. The second program provides state-based benefits that can offer financial support for assisted living. This program is either called Optional State Supplements (OSS) or State Supplementary Payments.People who are financially eligible can get assistance paying for room and board at an assisted living facility using OSS. This is in addition to Social Security Income payments and is paid directly to the community. The amount of OSS given to the resident is based on his or her income and can range from a few dollars to nearly $1,000 per month depending on income and state policies.Some states cap the amount assisted living communities that accept Medicaid can charge for room and board. This limit is usually equivalent to the federal Social Security Income benefit, or the Social Security Income benefit plus the OSS payment.HUD ResourcesThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, commonly known as HUD, offers a number of programs designed to help seniors and disabled individuals with housing expenses. These programs offer rent subsidies, income-based housing, vouchers, and homeownership opportunities.Programs typically have high demand, and applicants may face long waiting periods of two years or more. If you’re interested in a HUD program, it’s a good idea to start the application process as early as possible.Subsidized housing programsSubsidized housing programs offer income-based housing that’s designed to be affordable. Some programs offer rent assistance in facilities that offer support and activities for seniors and people with disabilities. HUD offers a state-based inventory of units for the elderly and persons with disabilities, which you can use to identify facilities that offer subsidized housing.Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly ProgramUnder the Section 202 program, HUD finances the development of supportive housing for the elderly. These facilities offer residential options with support activities including cleaning, cooking, and transportation. The program includes rental assistance funds, which are designed to make up the difference between HUD-approved operating costs and tenant rent contributions. Section 202 occupancy is available for very low-income households with at least one member who is 62 years of age or older.Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities ProgramThe section 811 program is similar to the Section 202 program, offering funding for the development and subsidizing of rental housing with support services for very low-income adults with disabilities. Like Section 202, Section 811 provides funding for development of supportive housing as well as rental assistance. Residents typically pay 30 percent of adjusted income.Public HousingHUD public housing offers rental housing to eligible low-income families, the elderly, and people with disabilities. Rent in public housing is limited to the highest of 30 percent of monthly adjusted income, 10 percent of monthly income, welfare rent (if applicable), or a minimum rent of $25 to $50 which is set by a local housing agency. Under HUD regulations, housing agencies can exclude $400 of income for  elderly families or a person with a disability, as well as some medical deductions for families whose head of household is an elderly person or a person with disabilities.Other programsHousing Choice Voucher ProgramHUD’s housing choice voucher program helps elderly, disabled, and very low-income families pay for private-market housing. Eligibility is typically limited to those with a household income of 50 percent or less than the median income for the county or metropolitan area in which they live. Housing voucher recipients can use their benefits to find housing, such as assisted living, and are not limited to living in subsidized housing projects. Housing choice vouchers are available locally through public housing agencies, known as PHAs, which receive federal funds to administer the program. The PHA pays housing subsidies directly to landlords on behalf of the individual or family.Home Equity Conversion MortgagesReverse mortgages are an option for seniors who have equity in their homes. With a reverse mortgage, senior homeowners are able to draw on home equity to pay for living expenses such as home health care. HUD’s Home Equity Conversion Mortgages, also known as HECMs, are reverse mortgages insured by the federal government available through Federal Housing Administration approved lenders.Homeownership Voucher Program​First-time home buyers can get help with monthly mortgage and homeownership expenses from the Homeownership Voucher Program. This program can reduce the total monthly payment to 30 percent of the family’s adjusted monthly income. There are certain eligibility requirements, including employment. However, employment is not required for elderly or disabled families.For more information, go to ​www.assistedliving.org/assisted-living-options-for-people-with-disabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

You may wish to review   Client Centered Counseling  Theory. I encourage you to print \"Session One - Client Centered Counseling\" for easier reading.  If Joan had been still meeting with an earlier client, she would have  ignored the phone but checked the time. It is crucial for a counselor to  stick to one’s time, out of respect for the next client. Joan’s  10 am client has left and Joan is just finishing the notes. Joan still  has five minutes so makes sure she is fed and watered and comfortable so  she can fully focus on this person.At 10:02 Joan goes out to the  waiting area. There are a few people there. Joan smiles and says, “Hi  there! I’m Joan.” Her client knows who she is and in this way Joan does  not have to announce the client’s name. But if there is no response, she  could say, “I’m looking for Mary.” Mary looks up and smiles,  Joan and Mary shake hands and Mary accompanies Joan to her office. Joan  makes small talk along the way to help keep Mary calm – while this is an  everyday thing for Joan, this is a first time for Mary. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction - The First Ten Minutes\n Joan shows Mary into her office for her first session. First  impressions are lasting impressions. Joan, as far as her colleagues are  concerned, dresses a little too casually. This does not convey a  professional look. And her office is eclectic – fish tanks with peculiar  objects in them, bamboo shoots in a variety of types of jar, artwork  from China as well as the Ladies Auxiliary, cat mug and cat calendar,  etc. She is taking a risk. Some clients could find this very off-putting  – they want a professional therapist not a nursery school teacher.At the same time, Joan and her office are neat and clean. The environment she is trying to achieve is “favorite Aunt” or genuineness since she is not a distanced specialist. She is a counselor, a listener, an advocate, a helper. Joan  offers Mary a glass of distilled water or a vitaminized milk drink and  makes the offer of an apple or granola bar. This is because she likes to  offer hospitality and because sometimes her clients don’t eat well. Low  blood sugar clouds thinking. Mary goes for a water and a bar to eat  later.Joan explains how this session will look.1.\tThere is a very Initial Assessment Form to fill out.2.\tThere is an Assurance of Confidentiality to sign and witness.3.\tMary, as a voluntary client, has the right not to answer any of these questions.4.\tThis form-filling-out won’t take very long.The  form provided by her agency requires very little information. Joan  skips the part about “reason for the visit” and will fill it in later.  This is because she does not want to interrupt her client once she  starts talking about her situation. While Joan does counseling from a  face to face perspective – she fills out the form sitting almost side by  side with Mary so that Mary can see what it being written down. This  builds trust.Joan assures Mary that “what’s said between the walls, stays between the walls” except in four situations:1.\tChildren are being neglected or abused.2.\tThe Court subpoenas Mary’s chart. (Unlikely, but client needs to be told this.)3.\tClient is leaving with the intent to commit serious physical violence against another person.4.\tClient is leaving with the intent to commit suicide or serious violence against herself.Joan  explains that in situations three and four she would try to have Mary  voluntarily go to Crisis Intervention at the hospital and would try to  have her accompanied. If Mary refused, Joan would immediately consult  her supervisor regarding the next step. Office protocols differ  from place to place, but it’s safe to say that in situation one the  Children’s Aid Society may need to be contacted (depending on severity  reported. Habitually forgetting to pack kids’ lunches is very different  from beating them with an implement.) In situations three and four it is likely the counselor and supervisor would have to call security or the police. It  is important to point out that situation one is normally handled by the  CAS. Situation two is a rare occurrence but a good reminder to take  careful notes, and three and four are not the norm either. Of course,  the setting you work in affects this – but as a student, volunteer or  “newbie”, you will be normally be shepherded and protected by your  mentor in any event.OK, the form filling is over. Thank heavens!  Boring but necessary and if you are really listening you may already be  forming some insights into your client. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation Gathering - The Next 20 Minutes \nJoan makes sure her body language is open, her tone is friendly and calm. She wants to convey empathy and acceptance  so that Mary will feel free to open up. Joan reaches for a pen and a  small note pad which can rest discreetly on her lap, and she asks the open ended question, “So what brings you in here today.”Mary  bursts into tears. When Joan first started counseling this bothered  her. Now she sees it as a good sign and offers Mary some tissues which  she has on hand. Joan knows that if Mary cannot stop crying, offering  her a glass of water will help. For reasons unknown to Joan, drinking  water slows the weeping down enough for that the client can talk.Mary  doesn’t know where to start so Joan says, “Start anywhere…”After about  fifteen minutes or so Mary has listed a number of concerns. 1.\tShe feels weepy “all the time.”2.\tShe’s failing at school.3.\tShe thinks her boyfriend doesn’t love her anymore.4.\tHer parents are driving her crazy with their phones calls and insistence she be a straight A student.•\tJoan has tried to use active listening  but has had to work at it. When Mary’s talked about crying jags, Joan  wanted to interrupt her and tell her about the virtues of crying – but  this is Joan’s turn to talk and talk and talk. •\tWhen Mary  mentioned not doing well in school, Joan noticed herself settling back  in her chair and crossing her arms – not an inviting posture. Joan might interpret this as a criticism or judgment. She discreetly corrected this.• \tWhen Mary wanted to talk about her boyfriend, Joan wanted to say, “Why  do you think that!?” But the “why” question can seem very caustic.• \tAnd when Mary mentioned her parents, Joan immediately started to think  about the last time she called her mom. Had it been three weeks? Oops!  Get on track!To keep herself on track and for charting later on, Joan finds it helpful to write down some key words for note taking. This time she wrote:- lots of crying- worried about school- boyfriend? love?- parents phone, relentlessSome  of Joan’s colleagues are able to discreetly chart and counsel at the  same time – Joan isn’t able to and that is fine. During a student  placement Joan was in a session where the social worker typed her notes  on a laptop while the client talked. The “clickety clickety” combined  with the attention given to the laptop made Joan wonder if perhaps it  was the computer that was there for counseling! •\tJoan was happy  she knew her basic counseling skills. At one point Mary, when talking  about crying, said, “I have another friend, Susan, who cries and cries.  And she … blah, blah, blah.” Joan was able to redirect her by saying,  “I’m glad you have a friend like Susan. Can you tell me more about the  times or things that seem to make you cry?” To practice client centered counseling  also means keeping the client on topic.•\tMary sounded like she was failing all her courses. So Joan asked her a closed question – “How many courses are you failing right now?” It was only one!• \tAt one point Mary seemed very unclear about Joan’s relationship with  her boyfriend Andy. Did Andy not want to be with Mary at all or did he  just not like it when she cried? Joan was able to use paraphrasing  to get a better grasp of the situation, saying, “What I think I hear  you saying is that Andy is uncomfortable when you cry and may leave the  room when you cry?” Mary says, “Yes, that’s how it is.”•\tAnd when  Mary was talking about the parents, at one point Mary just clammed up.  She wanted to say something, but couldn’t. So Joan used an active listening technique, “Tell me more about how you respond when your mom calls?” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion - The Next 10 Minutes \nNow Joan needs to take the material Mary has given her and paraphrase  it so that it is clear, “itemizable” and something that can be worked  on. Joan is always discreetly keeping an eye on the clock – she has it  on the shelf just behind the clients head. The client doesn’t even know  it’s there. Joan says in a friendly tentative tone, “OK Mary, I  need to review with you the things I think are the ones that are  bothering you, and then we can decide which one you’d like to work on  first.” Joan is about to paraphrase. I have put in numbers for the reader’s help, but Joan doesn’t use them.1. \t“It sounds like you are crying a lot and you don’t feel you have  control over when it’s going to happen and how often.” Mary nods her  head, “That’s right.”2.\t“It feels like you are failing all your  courses but there is only one course you are failing right now.” Mary  says, “Just one course I’m failing – but I am not doing as well as I  could in all of them.” 3.\t“Your boyfriend is a nice guy but he is  getting frustrated with the crying. He claims he loves you even if he  doesn’t say it unless asked.” Mary says, “Yeah…”4.\t“And your  parents, well they obviously care a lot. But they call so much you no  longer want to pick up the phone. Especially since you got a D on your  last essay.” Mary responds, “Yes, I sound like a terrible daughter,  don’t I!?” Joan doesn’t want to go down that road right now so she uses a  close-ended response, “No, you don’t!”*****There  is no way that all of these can be worked on today so Joan asks her,  “What do you want to address first!?” Mary is emphatic, “I can’t deal  with the others until I can deal with the crying.”There is  nothing Joan would love to do more than preach at Mary about steps she  needs to take to stop crying and start living and give her a fact sheet.  But that would make Mary feel horrible – like she was failing even  more. And Joan doesn’t live in Mary’s body 24/7. Mary knows but needs to  think about it, be able to describe it for herself, listen to what she  has said, and thereby get more perspective on it. Joan's job is to provide a growth promoting climate.It  is now 11:40 and time to starting winding down – at the time they just  are getting started. It would be tempting for Joan just to skip her  lunch and keep going with Mary. And in an emergency – for example if  Mary had to be taken to the hospital by taxi – Joan might have to in  order to accompany her (to make sure she goes and stays.)But Joan knows that:1. \tif she burns out by not taking her breaks, she’ll be no good to  anybody. She has learned this by experience as have most people in the  counseling profession. 2.\tIf this was a 10 am client, she would  have to be winding down now to permit note taking, a three minute run to  the lady’s room, and still start the next appointment as close to 11 as  possible.3.\tIn fact Mary has already done a huge amount of work today. i.\tShe had admitted she has problems and she needs some help – the first and biggest step. ii. \tShe has thought about them, said them out loud and had them repeated  back to her, therefore she is more aware of what it is that is bothering  her.iii.\tBy doing step ii she already has some perspective on her problems.iv.\tBecause her counselor is so affirming and understanding, Mary knows that these challenges can be dealt with.4.\tHomework will extend the session and learning into the whole next week!Joan  says, “Mary, I need you to know that what you are describing – while  very difficult for you – is very ‘doable’ for you. These are challenges  that many people face and by acknowledging you have problems, reflecting  on them, and explaining them to another person – in this case, me – you  are well on your way to dealing with them.” Joan is careful to reflect content and feelings.Joan continues, “Mary I want you to chart your crying this week. Here is a seven day or weekly time chart  that I use for time management but also works for mood mapping. I am  asking you to rate your mood on a scale from one to five – one is very  sad – three is neutral – five is very happy. If you like you can draw  faces instead. Instead of hourly, I’m asking you for your general mood  from when you wake up until noon, noon to three, three to six, six to  nine, and nine to when you go to bed. I also want you to chart what you  are doing during this time – where you are and with whom. There may be  some patterns here. Bring this with you to your next appointment so we  can review it and strategize.”As part of her holistic health  approach, Joan requires all of her clients to have a wellness  appointment to rule out health concerns. “Mary, I need you to book an  appointment with your family doctor or nurse practitioner to have a  health check up. You need to book that today. Sometimes the reason we  are not feeling well is that we have a physiologic problem – for  example, low hemoglobin, low blood sugar, low thyroid, high blood  pressure, and that sort of thing. By getting that adjusted, we will  start to feel better physically as we start feeling better emotionally. The  secretary will be happy to let you use her phone.” Joan is not using  “we” in a condescending way. She means “all of us” – not just Joan. \n\n\n\nConclusion - The Last 10 Minutes \nJoan gives all of her clients her “business card” which is really an information card with emergency numbers on it. The health services number is on it.Joan Smith MA RSW\t[email protected]\t123-4567 #8910\twww.college.com/joan-smithImportant Numbers\temergency number: 911\t24/7 crisis intervention: 234-5678\twarm line: 345-6789 – 8 to 4, Mon to Fri, except holidays\thealth services appt: 123-4567 #5678\tcounseling appt: 123-4567 #4321It  is crucial for clients to know they are never alone. There is always  someone \"there to care.\" Joan encourages her clients – if they are  having a particularly difficult day – to leave a message on her  answering machine or email her. Within two days, Joan will make a quick  follow up call or email – just to assure the person that she or he has  been heard and this concern can be addressed at their next appointment. The Goodie Bag Joan knows that her clients may never remember what she said,  but they will remember how she made them feel. So all of her clients get  a goodie bag at their first visit – it’s a gift bag or cloth bag with  information and items that are useful and fun. See Handouts for more on this. Journal and PenJoan also encourages her clients to  accept a simple notebook or journal and a colorful pen to jot things  down with over the next few weeks. As they reflect on themselves and  their relationships with others, they may have interesting dreams or  insights “out of the blue”!*****As the client is getting  ready to leave, Joan asks her if she has anything to look forward to  over the next few days and pushes at Mary until she comes up with them.  Mary admits she and Andy are going to a movie, her next step is a coffee  with her friend Sally, and her favorite TV show is on tonight.If  Mary could not come up with anything at all, Joan would have to ask  Mary if she was thinking of hurting herself, of committing suicide. And  if so, Joan would follow the office protocol regarding suspected suicide  risk. But to be honest, if the client was suicidal, Joan would have had  some indications earlier on and would have gotten help from her mentor  or supervisor.Joan reaches out her hand to shake Mary’s and  thanks her for coming in and walks with her toward the desk where Mary  can make another appointment. She is encouraging Mary to come in once a  week for the next three weeks. This is a matter of routine. If the  client doesn’t book there and then, she might not. And even if she calls  a week later, the appointment spaces that fit with her classes may be  filled already.At Joan’s workplace, hugging the client is not  permitted. Clients are vulnerable and actions can be misinterpreted. If  the client hugs Joan, Joan is careful not to embrace but to put her  hands warmly on the clients arms and assure her that she is a good  person, and she can do this.*****Sounds overwhelming? It’s not. Remember that...the  most important thing is that the client feels she/he was listened to,  was heard. And that, because you are there and you care, there is hope,  there is a future. - / janEnd of Client Centered Counseling Sample Session \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy  at AllPosters.com\n\n\n\n\ntake me to the top of the page!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            " Joan  skips the part about “reason for the visit” and will fill it in later.  This is because she does not want to interrupt her client once she  starts talking about her situation. While Joan does counseling from a  face to face perspective – she fills out the form sitting almost side by  side with Mary so that Mary can see what it being written down. This  builds trust.Joan assures Mary that “what’s said between the walls, stays between the walls” except in four situations:1.\tChildren are bei",

She wants to convey empathy and acceptance  so that Mary will feel free to open up. Joan reaches for a pen and a  small note pad which can rest discreetly on her lap, and she asks the open ended question, “So what brings you in here today.”Mary  bursts into tears.

Joan might interpret this as a criticism or judgment. She discre",

Had it been three weeks? Oops!  Get on track!To keep herself on track and for charting later on, Joan finds it helpful to write down some key words for note taking. This time she wrote:- lots of crying- worried about school-",

During a student  placement Joan was in a session where the social worker typed her notes  on a laptop while the client talked.

Did Andy not want to be with Mary at all or did he  just not like it when she cried? Joan was able to use paraphrasing  to get a better grasp of the situation, saying, “What I think I hear  you saying is that Andy is uncomfortable when you cry and may leave the  room when you cry?” Mary says, “Yes, that’s how it is.”•\tAnd when  Mary was talking about the parents, at one poi",

Here is a seven day or weekly time chart  that I use for time management but also works for mood mapping. I am  asking you to rate your mood on a scale from one to five – one is very  sad – three is neutral – five is very happy. If you like you can draw  faces instead. Instead of hourly, I’m asking you for your general mood  from when you wake up until noon, noon to three, three to six, six to  nine",

Bring this with you to your next appointment so we  can review it and strategize.”As part of her holistic health  approach, Joan requires all of her clients to have a wellness  appointment to rule out health concerns. “Mary, I need you to book an  appointment with your family doctor or nurse practitioner to have a  health check up. You n",

Sometimes the reason we  are not feeling well is that we have a physiologic problem – for  example, low hemoglobin, low blood sugar, low thyroid, high blood  pressure, and that sort of thing. By getting that adjusted, we will  start to feel better physically as we start feeling better emotionally. The  secretary will be happy to let you use her phone.” Joan is not using  “we” in a condescending way. She means “all of us” – not just Joan. \n\n\n\nConclusion - The Last 10 Minut",

Over one billion people are struggling to survive on  less than one dollar a day. This is a moral challenge. We have  the money, the materials and the know-how – but we cannot see our way to  benevolent self-interest, let alone compassion.According the African business newsletter,  www. businessafrica.net , the cost of waging the Gulf War of 1991 – a “small” war by comparison  to the one in Iraq – is well over US $100 billion. And over $200 billion  if you include the “collateral” damage of the Persian Gulf's oil  pollution and the repairs of Kuwait's oils wells set ablaze by Iraq.  What a staggering waste of natural and human resources! According  to the editor, Dr. B.M. Quenum, this amount of money – US $200 billion -  could lift impoverished African countries from the \"poverty league\" of  GNP US$ 300 / year to \"bearable living conditions league\" of GNP US$  2,500 / year. (This represents US$ 200 million per year over a period of  maximum 10 years.)You and I need to understand that the major  cause of violence and disease is poverty. At the same time you and I  know that many people in the “developed” world are going to live their  whole lives in desperate poverty. Is there a way - a why to bear a how -  to live with dignity and purpose in a brutal and seemingly hopeless  situation?***** Having never been poor or made to suffer, I do not have the  qualifications to comment on this, so I am instead sharing with you the  perspective of Dr. Viktor Frankl. In 1942 Frankl, his wife and parents  and most of his family entered Auschwitz. He alone survived. During his  enslavement, he understood his purpose to prevent despondency and  suicide among his fellow inmates.After the camps were liberated  by the allies, Frankl wrote his book, “Man's Search for Meaning.” Here  is a section from this book that is listed as \"the ten most influential  books in [the United States].\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Strength: Finding a Why To Bear a How - Viktor Frankl \n\nAs we said before, any attempt to restore a man's inner strength in  the camp had first to succeed in showing him some future goal.  Nietzsche's words, \"He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how,\" could be the guiding motto for all psychotherapeutic and psychohygienic efforts regarding prisoners. Whenever  there was an opportunity for it, one had to give them a why - an aim -  for their lives, in order to strengthen them to bear the terrible how of  their existence. Woe to him who saw no more sense in his life, no aim,  no purpose, and therefore no point in carrying on. He was soon lost. The  typical reply with which such a man rejected all encouraging arguments  was, \"I have nothing to expect from life any more.\" What sort of answer  can one give to that?  What was really needed was a fundamental change in our  attitude toward life. We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had  to teach the despairing men, that  it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us.   We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to  think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life - daily  and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation,  but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking  the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to  fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBooks and Video \nBooks “Where Is God When It Hurts?:   : A Comforting, Healing Guide for Coping with Hard Times”by Philip Yancey, Zondervan, 1997 “The Resilient Spirit:   Transforming Suffering Into Insight and Renewal” by Polly Young-Eisendrath, Da Capo Press, 1997VideoInterviews with Viktor Frankl – Watch All Three! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EIxGrIc_6g&feature=related \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life.

The  typical reply with which such a man rejected all encouraging arguments  was, \"I have nothing to expect from life any more.\" What sort of answer  can one give to that?  What was really needed was a fundamental change in our  attitude toward life. We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had  to teach the despairing men, that  it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us.   We neede",

It usually forms in the lungs of those who have been exposed to this deadly toxin, but sometimes occurs in the abdominal area or the area around the heart.Approximately 3,000 people are diagnosed with mesothelioma of all types in the United States every year. In most cases, these victims’ exposure took place on the job and the cause of the illness can be traced to an unsafe workplace.

Ivey, Mary Bradford Ivey, Carlos P. Zalaquettby) is the practice of writing down pieces of information,  often in a shorthand and messy manner. The listener needs to be discreet  and not disturb the flow of thought, speech or body language of the  speaker. \nNote taking is a mixed blessing. It can keep you on track, but it can  also be distracting for the client. Also, it can interfere with  communication if you are tempted to rest your eyes on the pen and paper,  or take copious notes.At the same time, if you don’t take notes,  how will you be able to remember what happened last session? If you are  away, how will the alternate counselor know what is going on.There  are also the institutional requirements of the place you volunteer for,  are doing a placement at, or work for. They may very well provide a  form with strict guidelines.You can get the “data details” (name, phone, source of referral, emergency contact, etc.) at the beginning of the session.When  the person is actually conveying her/his situation and concerns, you  may want to take minimal notes – writing down a few words for each major  area – as a memory jog. The real note taking comes later. I encourage  you to write up your notes immediately after a session. I like the SOAP  method which is used in health care.In counseling, it becomes SAPO.Subjective – What the client is describing?Assessment – What was the ensuing discussion?Plan  – What is the action plan? Remember, there are 23 hours in the rest of  the day. Most of the work of counseling is done by the client outside of  office hours!Other – What do you need to do in order to  be prepared for the next visit? Is there any info you wish you had  gathered or given? If some information is crucial you can always phone  or email the client.Note: While everything you write is confidential, the court may have the right to subpoena your chart(s). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Class Homework - Note Taking Exercise: 10 minutes of active listening and brief note taking and 5 minutes of feedbackListener:  Get ready with your active listening skills, encouraging body language  and tone, and a notebook and pen that works. Be prepared to take minimal  notes, barely looking at the writing materials.Speaker:  Talk about something that bothered you within the last week or so. For  example, getting a bad report, a cranky child or parent, getting cut-off  in traffic, etc.***** Listener1.\tDid you find it difficult to listen and write?2.\tDid you find it easier to keep on track this way?Speaker1.\tDid you find the note taking distracting?2.\tDid you feel more or less attended to in this session? ***** Out of Class HomeworkIf you don’t already, start  writing “laundry lists.” This is when you put in short form what you are  going to do on a particular day. Only, try to do this without looking  at the page. It’s an art! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of note taking gone bad…A new business was  opening and one of the owner's friends wanted to send flowers for the  occasion. They arrived at the new business site and the owner read the  card; it said \"Rest in Peace\". The owner was offended and  called his friend. His friend assured him it was an error and called the  florist to complain. After he had told the florist of the obvious  mistake and how embarrassed he was, the florist said: “Sir,  I'm really sorry for the mistake, but if you think you feel  discombobulated, realize this: somewhere there is a funeral taking place  today, and they have flowers with a note saying 'Congratulations on  your new location'.\" \n\n\n\n\nBuy  at AllPosters.com\n \n\n\n\nTAKE ME TO THE TOP OF THE PAGE!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I must have the love and approval of others. I must avoid disapproval at all costs.2. I must be perfect, a success in all that I do. I must not make any mistakes.3. People must always do the right thing. When they do not, they must be punished.4. Things must be the way that I want them to be – otherwise life will be intolerable.5. My happiness (or unhappiness) is caused by external events. I have no control over my happiness (or unhappiness).  6. I must worry about things that might be dangerous, unpleasant or frightening – otherwise they might happen.7. I will be happier if I can avoid life’s difficulties, unpleasantness or responsibilities.8. I am weak and need to depend on those who are stronger than I am.9. Events in the past have strongly influenced me – and they must continue to do so.10. I must be upset when others have problems. I must become sad when others are unhappy.11. I should not have to feel discomfort or pain. I must avoid them at all costs.12. There is one right and perfect solution to any problem (usually mine). It is a tragedy when it is not found.****If  only lies were benign – but they never are.  They invade every fibre of  our being, making it increasing difficult for us to see the good in  ourselves. And as I have asserted before, we cannot build on muck. Nor  can we build on a false bottom. We need the concrete truth.So  what are the lies you are telling yourself right now. I will share with  you four lies I hear people tell themselves. It’s like everyone got  invited to the same pity party. But I’ll also share with you one truth  that needs to be addressed – meaning, it ain’t no lie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFour Destructive and Common Lies \n\n1. I have to make everyone happy.WRONG!  You cannot  make everyone happy. Even God cannot make everyone happy – half the  people are praying for rain and half are praying for sun. Can you  imagine how God must be shaking his head at football games when both  teams are praying for a victory?A  GENTLER RESPONSE: Think before  you speak or act. Is this in agreement with those things you know to be  good, true and beautiful?  We cannot achieve a personal or social  vicotry in every situation of wrong-doing, but we can have a moral  victory by asserting what we know to be true and acting on it.  2. I’ll never find a way out of this.NYET! You found a way into it, and it took a long time. A  GENTLER RESPONSE: With help, you can slowly crawl back out of this. If  you take one small step a day and enlist the help of others, you can do  this. But you need to start right now. An exercise on goal setting and  achieving is available on this website.3. Why do bad things always happen to me?UNTRUE!  Yes, bad things have happened to you – but you are taking steps to  ensure (to the best of your ability) that your “luck” is changing.A  GENTLER RESPONSE: Why do you think bad things shouldn’t happen to you?  This is the price of admission to the “I’m a human being” club. I grant  you that much of what passes for back luck is injustice at some level  and that for the poorest of the poor, there may not be cause for hope in  their lifetimes.  But if you have access to a computer and the time to  read this, you are not one of them. And while I don’t wish “bad” on  anyone, I do know the bad can be redeemed – can be used to make your own  life that that of others, better. 4.  People p*ss me off. I have a hard time getting along with others.PARTLY  TRUE!  The second part, that is. In the first part – except in extreme  cases (like torture) – you are overreacting to what other people see as  mere blips on the screen.A GENTLER RESPONSE: People don’t have to  adore each other – but they have to be able to interact. It helps to  mentally put on a thick layer of  vaseline or glidex and imagine things  sliding off your armor. Your sword and shield? A smile and a pleasant  voice. It disarms people. None of us is so important that there is a  group of people out there who exist to ruin our days. If,  however, it’s only in one situtation this is happening – for example,  your workplace – you may be working in a toxic environment. You need to  be working on two things: a) your exit strategy – in this case finding a  new job; and b) coping strategies – my favorite of which is smiling and  sliding through (ie refusing to get stuck in negativity.)5. I have ZERO energy.LIKELY  TRUE! Didn’t think I’d every agree with you, eh?  If you are not eating  extremely nutritious food and drinking water, avoiding the  anti-nutrients, getting your sleep and lots of walking in...  Well,  let’s just say, if your body was a car, your mechanic would make his/her  next few mortgage payments off of you.A HELPFUL RESPONSE?! All  of the above plus the rest of the whole health check in. Remember that  every cell in your body is made from the food you eat – or don’t eat.  Live like crap, feel like crap. It’s that simple. Plus taking care of  your whole health – social, emotional, spiritual, intellectual, and  vocational as well as physical – boosts your energy level and immune  system.Now, I invite you to take part in this exercise…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive Things I Don’t Like about Me  (and no more than five, so make them good) \n\nInvite your accountability partner to go for decaf coffee.  First list the five things – then examine them carefully.1. TRUE? FALSE?MORE HELPFUL RESPONSE?IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY!2.TRUE? FALSE?MORE HELPFUL RESPONSE?IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY!  3.TRUE?

If you want to get hired for your dream job, you need to start by dazzling the hiring managers. Here are a few ways you can make an excellent first impression and boost your chances of getting an offer. Polish Up Your Resume  The very first step in landing your dream job is to put together a stand-out resume. If you’ve never written a resume before, or it’s been awhile, don’t worry — there are plenty of resume resources online that can help you style, word, and polish your resume to absolute perfection. Before you start sending it out, be sure to check for misspelled words, typos, and other common mistakes. A second pair of eyes is helpful for spotting mistakes, so ask a friend to help. Put Your Best Face Forward You got a call for an interview! That’s exciting news, but try not to get too stressed out or anxious. Anxiety and stress can make your skin go crazy, and the last thing you want is for your grooming or hygiene to get in the way of making an amazing first impression. In fact, this is the perfect time to splurge on tools and products that will help you look your best. So, pick up some new makeup or hot rollers that help you feel like the best version of yourself for your interview. That confidence is sure to come through to the hiring managers! Nail Your Interview Outfit Now that you’ve got your hair, skin, and nails taken care of, it’s time to move on to the interview outfit. What you wear to your interview will depend on the type of job you are applying for, as well as the company. If you can, take a look at what typical managers and staff members wear to work, and take your interview style up a notch or two from there. Whatever you wear, make sure it’s clean and free of wrinkles before you step out. Do Your Homework  The biggest mistake many job applicants make is not researching the company ahead of the interview. You are guaranteed to get some questions around your knowledge of the company, so make sure you have some good answers prepared well ahead of time. Most organizations have websites where you can find the interview information you need, but LinkedIn and social media accounts can also provide a ton of help. Practice, Practice, Practice Interviews can be very nerve-wracking, especially if it’s your first one. A good way to beat some of that anxiety is to practice answering questions ahead of time. You can look up typical interview questions online, then have a friend help you role-play your interview. This allows you to develop some thoughtful answers to common questions while also giving you the chance to practice the all-important elevator speech about yourself. Get Some Decent Sleep  You’ve got your research done and outfit all picked out — now it’s time to get some rest! Sleep will help your mind stay focused and keep you looking well-rested for your interview. If you are having a difficult time relaxing, try some stress-relieving techniques that will put your mind and body at ease for a good night’s sleep. Take a warm bath, do some yoga, or use noise machine app to help you get the rest you need. Always Remember to Say ‘Thank You’  The interview is done and you are feeling great, but your efforts to snag your dream job shouldn’t stop there. After the interview, it’s always a good idea to send a note of thanks to the hiring manager as well as any other staff members who were part of your interview. Keep it short, but be sure to mention details to help yourself stand out from other applicants. Now that you’ve read through this article, you have everything you need to make a good impression and breeze through your interview. So, be sure to take some deep breaths, be yourself, and get out there and get the job you’ve always dreamed of having! Photo Credit: Unsplash​\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Physical (nutrition, avoiding harmful substances, sleep, exercise, health care)2. Social (friends, family, co-workers, pets)3. Emotional (self care, laughter, hobbies) 4. Spiritual (altruism, Higher Power, volunteering)5. Intellectual (university, learning something new)6. Vocational (meaningful work)I would add to that the social determinants of health and for students these include:7. enough money (part-time work, bursaries)8. safe housing (off campus housing, rez) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis \"Loot and Learning\" Bag is mostly to help clients and you have some  fun – but also to reinforce the six (to eight) components of whole  health. G. B. ToysPhysical - nutritious snack Social – mug Emotional – “stuffy” (plush toy)Spiritual – journal / note padIntellectual – interesting penVocational – tote bag---------- G. B. Information Physical – School and community resourcesSocial – Recreational activitiesEmotional – Jan’s “business card”Spiritual - freebies card (ie for plants, fish, cats, mystery novels, homemade blankets, lending library of books and videos)Intellectual – school success bookletVocational – career options infoNaturally,  goodie bag  contents and information would be geared to the population you serve. Dollar stores, garage sales, bargain basements and  second-hand stores  are a great source for these treasures. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The most thoroughly wasted of all days is that on which one has not laughed. - Nicolas de Chamfort \n\n\n\n\nBuy  at AllPosters.com\n\n\n\n\ntake me to the top of the page!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

A counselor will be able to offer guidance and support along your journey to an alcohol-free life. No matter how long you’ve struggled with alcoholism or how much you drink, alcohol counseling can make a huge difference in your recovery.Many alcohol rehab facilities use comprehensive recovery plans in their treatment process. Comprehensive recovery plans view and treat the entire person. They can consist of inpatient or outpatient rehabs, medication-assisted therapies, counseling sessions, support groups and other types of treatment. Some elements of a comprehensive recovery plan, like rehab and medication-assisted therapies, can be completed over the course of a few months. Other parts, such as counseling sessions and support groups, are crucial for on-going treatment and maintaining your sobriety.Don’t let an AUD define you. With the help of an alcohol counselor, you will be able to learn about how to prevent triggers, work through cravings and live a healthier life. Contact us today to explore different types of treatment available nearby.​For the rest of this information, go to ​https://www.alcoholrehabguide.org/treatment/counseling/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

New research indicates, however, that stress and mental conditions like anxiety and depression are also related to poor gut health. Maintaining a healthy gut microbiome is important for both your physical and mental health. How can stress hamper your gut health, and how can depleted microbiome levels in turn harm your mental health?The Relationship Between Stress And Gut HealthA review published in the Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology found that exposure to stress results in changes in brain-gut interactions. These alterations lead to the development of a wide range of gastrointestinal problems - including inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel symptoms, peptic ulcers, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Just one of the many effects of stress on the gut involves an increase in intestinal permeability. Because stress has such a powerful effect on health, it is vital to battle it proactively, through proven approaches such as meditation, time spent in nature, yoga and regular workouts. These activities all keep cortisol (stress hormone) levels down, but they also have a wide array of additional physical and mental health benefits.How Can Poor Gut Health Affect Stress-Related Conditions?Stress can be considered a risk factor for two of America’s most prevalent mental conditions - depression and anxiety, which also have a proven link to gut health. A 2015 study by Jessica Yano et al found that since gut microbes regulate the levels of serotonin ('feel good neurotransmitters' or 5-HT receptors), altering microbiota can improve symptoms of diseases related to 5-HT - including depression. Another study (by researchers at the Flanders Institute for Biotechnology) found that people with depression tended to have low levels of two bacteria in particular - coprococcus and dialister). Scientists stated that it is vital to have a wide array of microbiota for optimal mental health because each type of bacteria plays a different role. Some microorganisms can produce substances that are associated with a better mental quality of life.Gut Health And AnxietyResearch published in the journal General Psychiatry has found that people battling anxiety can alleviate their symptoms by building a healthy gut microbiome. In the paper, researchers reviewed 21 studies, finding that two approaches (taking probiotics and consuming a healthy diet) can help healthy microorganisms thrive in the gut and thereby alleviate anxiety. Interestingly, the biggest reduction in anxiety was found among those who simply adjusted their diet. Researchers recommend a diet comprising lean proteins, fruit and vegetables, healthy fats, and pulses. A fiber-rich diet is vital for microbiomes to thrive, since fiber provides healthy bacteria with a kind of ‘net’ that can help them grow in numbers.Recent studies have pointed to an important link between gut and brain health. Depleted levels of microbiota are linked to depression, stress and anxiety. To improve your microbiome, consume a Mediterranean-style diet that is high in fiber and low in sugar and refined products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

How can stress hamper your gut health, and how can depleted microbiome levels in turn harm your mental health?The Relationship Between Stress And Gut HealthA review published in the Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology found that exposure to stress results in changes in brain-gut interactions.

Just one of the many effects of stress on the gut involves an increase in intestinal permeability. Because stress has such a powerful effect on health, it is vital to battle it proactively, through proven approaches such as meditation, time spent in nature, yoga and regular workouts. These activities all keep cortisol (stress hormone",

Individuals who are in a position of leadership often feel the pressure of both running daily operations and managing their employees, while hourly workers deal with stressors related to deadlines, customer service, and working in a fast-paced environment. Learning the right ways to handle stress--both yours and that of your employees--can help ensure that everyone has a positive work experience, which can in turn boost productivity and sales. So here are some tips and resources to get you started, courtesy of Basic Counseling Skills.Redirect Your AttitudeIt can be difficult to focus on positivity when you’re feeling pressure from upper management, or when sales are down and everyone is scrambling to catch up. Take a deep breath and remember that the way you speak to your employees can make or break the situation. Not only does it affect the morale of your team, but it also creates a ripple effect that could prove to be costly to your business. In other words, seek out the problem and look for ways to solve it rather than blaming your employees. Ask for their input on how to improve things and always remain vocal about their achievements in front of one another while holding them accountable in private meetings. Remain Culturally AwareWhile it’s essential to remain positive within the work environment, it’s also important to seek out the different causes for stress or tension while keeping in mind that cultural differences can play a role.

It is common for people with addictions to have sleep disorders and for people to use substances like drugs and alcohol to treat their sleep problems, which oftentimes results in addiction. People may use drugs and alcohol to self-medicate, or to help promote sleep or wakefulness. Similarly, people in recovery from addiction experience sleep problems, which can make the recovery process difficult and symptoms may trigger relapse.According to Dr. Kima Joy Taylor, director of the Closing the Addiction Treatment Gap (CATG) initiative, only 11 percentof Americans seek treatment for addiction, leaving 20 million Americans untreated. Common signs of addiction, according to the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug dependence, include:Using drugs or alcohol longer than a person wants to or than intendedNeglecting activities because of time spent with drug and alcohol useHiding substance useHaving issues with relationshipsNeeding more of the substance because of an increased toleranceFeeling the effects of withdrawal from drugs or alcoholTaking risks to obtain alcohol or drugsShowing physical signs of not taking care of one’s selfContinuing to use substances despite the problems associated with use Source: The National Center on Addiction and Substance AbuseSymptoms of addiction include:Intense urges to useThe feeling that you need to use regularlyMaking sure you have enough of a supplyNeeding more of the substance to get the same feelingContinuing to use even though you know the consequencesSpending a lot of time getting the substanceSpending money and oftentimes more than you have on the substanceDoing things you know could cause damage to obtain the substanceFailing to stop usingGoing through withdrawal symptoms when you try to stop using In this guide, we will explore the relationship between addiction and sleep, and will discuss:How addiction can contribute to sleep loss or sleep deprivationHow feeling rested helps in recoveryTo read the rest of this article, go to ​https://mattresshelp.org/addiction-sleep/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It will take time to come to terms with life after such a tragic loss, but the important thing is to take things at your own pace. Eventually, though, you might find that continuing to live in the same space you shared with your loved one is affecting your mental health in a negative way. Moving to a new home for a change of scenery can do you a world of good. Relocating is an involved process, but you can manage it with some effective tips for handling both the general tasks and the tough ones. Prepare for the Housing MarketThe moving process starts by finding a home you can envision yourself thriving in for years to come. Consider the location, neighborhood, and any hobbies you want to practice on or near your new property. Budget is another obvious concern, but you can make this aspect more manageable by finding ways to get a lower mortgage rate. When you're ready to put your current home on the market, try using an online property valuation tool to get an early idea of what your house might be worth. Keep in mind that there is no replacement for a reputable real estate agent who can help you navigate the buying and selling process with a practiced hand. Find Professional Moving HelpBefore you are ready to make the move, start conducting a search for a qualified furniture mover in your area ahead of time. If you have large or expensive items, be sure to find a local mover with good reviews and sufficient experience. As you research moving companies, you might find that you can save a fair bit of money by working with movers who are currently offering special deals or credits. If you are a business owner working from home, your biggest priority during the move will be to get your office setup back to an operational state as soon as possible. For minimal disruption, be sure to pack your work equipment together and label boxes very carefully. Prioritize Safety at All TimesEveryone knows that moving can be stressful and time-consuming, but it's easy to overlook common hazards that can arise during the moving process as well. For example, relocation experts explain that torn rotator cuffs and slipped discs are among the most common moving injuries. Investing in high-quality moving products is a must for the sake of your family's safety. You need durable cardboard boxes that can hold the weight of your belongings and bubble wrap for fragile objects and knives with sharp edges, to name just a couple. Remember to always read in-depth product reviews before making a purchase to ensure that you're getting the best product for your money. Address Your Loved One's BelongingsPerhaps the most difficult task you must complete when moving after a tragic loss is to deal with your loved one's belongings. You must determine which items you wish to keep, which ones will be too painful to have around, and which ones you must discard despite their sentimental value. Do not hesitate to reach out to a professional counseling service at any point to get the help you need with processing your feelings during this difficult time. You can also use the information found on Basic Counseling Skills to help you during these conversations. Moving is never easy, and neither is grieving. However, the two sometimes come hand-in-hand when you are processing the loss of someone important. Experiencing a change of scenery might be just what you need for finding renewed peace of mind.Image via Pexels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

One instance in which your patients may feel even more distress related to their phobias is when these fears pop up while on vacation. Instead of taking time off to rest, recharge and have fun, specific phobias can make each of these goals impossible. In addition to the use of active listening and other basic counseling techniques, explore some of the top ways to treat phobias that can flare up while individuals are traveling. Dealing with the fear of travel itselfThe act of traveling has the potential to trigger numerous kinds of fears. For example, those who experience motion sickness can become anxious and hyper focused on ways to prevent the illness.² They may even avoid fun activities so that they do not develop the nausea associated with the condition. However, when the focus of one’s phobia is the actual act of traveling, it is known as hodophobia. Leaving one’s home or using certain modes of transportation can lead to symptoms such as a rapid heartbeat, headaches and digestive issues.³ The latest research has shown that several treatment methods are particularly effective for patients with hodophobia. The first is anti-anxiety medication. When taken before a trip, mental health professionals have found that certain prescriptions have a high level of efficacy in treating hodophobia symptoms. In conjunction with medication, therapy techniques can further help patients cope. More specifically, exposure therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are particularly useful. Extreme fear of waterWhether traveling in summer or winter, some of the most ideal travel destinations involve some level of exposure to water. From visiting gorgeous beaches to swimming at the resort pool, water is everywhere. For individuals who have a phobia of water (aquaphobia), this prospect can feel like a nightmare. Just the sight of water can prompt symptoms such as nausea, dizziness, rapid heartbeat, a tight feeling in the chest, and intense fear and anxiety. The Mayo Clinic reports that aquaphobia most frequently occurs as a result of a traumatic experience with water in childhood. The condition can also be caused by multiple negative experiences with water (that were not traumatic), or it can be an inherited condition. Rather than prescribing medication right away, researchers have found that CBT and/or exposure therapy are the best ways to overcome the phobia. Coping with busy and tight spacesUnless an individual plans to travel to a remote spot, popular travel destinations can quickly trigger symptoms of claustrophobia (the extreme fear of crowded or small spaces). Theme parks, concerts, shopping complexes and cruise ships can all cause the condition to flare up. Unfortunately, this can severely limit vacation options for those with claustrophobia. To help give patients coping techniques that allow them to better handle busy/small spaces, there are multiple effective techniques that counselors and therapists can employ. Rational emotive behavioral therapy (REBT), visualization and medication can actually help people recover from the phobia.⁴ If full recovery is not achieved, many patients go on to better manage the intensity and duration of their symptoms. Having the ability to relax and enjoy time off is extremely important for all individuals. While this goal may be a massive challenge for people with specific phobias, the techniques described can help lead to positive short and long-term outcomes for patients. Resources:https://www.healthline.com/health/aquaphobia, Healthline, September 10, 2019https://www.riverranchboats.com/prevent-motion-sickness/, River Ranch Boats, September 10, 2019https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-fear-of-travel-2671901, Very Well Mind, June 4, 2019https://www.mindful.org/a-mindfulness-practice-for-facing-your-fears/, Mindful, July 3, 2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            " or on a daily basis. One instance in which your patients may feel even more distress related to their phobias is when these fears pop up while on vacation. Instead of taking time off to rest, recharge and have fun, specific phobias can make each of these goals impossible. In addition to the use of active listening and other basic counseling techniques, explore some of the top ways to treat phobias that can flare up while individuals are traveling. Dealing with the fear of travel itselfThe act o",
            "f traveling has the potential to trigger numerous kinds of fears. For example, those who experience motion sickness can become anxious and hyper focused on ways to prevent the illness.² They may even avoid fun activities so that they do not develop the nausea associated with the condition. However, when the focus of one’s phobia is the actual act of traveling, it is known as hodophobia. Leaving one’s home or using certain modes of transportation can lead to symptoms such as a rapid heartbeat, he",
            "adaches and digestive issues.³ The latest research has shown that several treatment methods are particularly effective for patients with hodophobia. The first is anti-anxiety medication. When taken before a trip, mental health professionals have found that certain prescriptions have a high level of efficacy in treating hodophobia symptoms. In conjunction with medication, therapy techniques can further help patients cope. More specifically, exposure therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) ",
            "are particularly useful. Extreme fear of waterWhether traveling in summer or winter, some of the most ideal travel destinations involve some level of exposure to water. From visiting gorgeous beaches to swimming at the resort pool, water is everywhere. For individuals who have a phobia of water (aquaphobia), this prospect can feel like a nightmare. Just the sight of water can prompt symptoms such as nausea, dizziness, rapid heartbeat, a tight feeling in the chest, and intense fear and anxiety. T",
            "he Mayo Clinic reports that aquaphobia most frequently occurs as a result of a traumatic experience with water in childhood. The condition can also be caused by multiple negative experiences with water (that were not traumatic), or it can be an inherited condition. Rather than prescribing medication right away, researchers have found that CBT and/or exposure therapy are the best ways to overcome the phobia. Coping with busy and tight spacesUnless an individual plans to travel to a remote spot, p",
            "opular travel destinations can quickly trigger symptoms of claustrophobia (the extreme fear of crowded or small spaces). Theme parks, concerts, shopping complexes and cruise ships can all cause the condition to flare up. Unfortunately, this can severely limit vacation options for those with claustrophobia. To help give patients coping techniques that allow them to better handle busy/small spaces, there are multiple effective techniques that counselors and therapists can employ. Rational emotive ",
            "behavioral therapy (REBT), visualization and medication can actually help people recover from the phobia.⁴ If full recovery is not achieved, many patients go on to better manage the intensity and duration of their symptoms. Having the ability to relax and enjoy time off is extremely important for all individuals. While this goal may be a massive challenge for people with specific phobias, the techniques described can help lead to positive short and long-term outcomes for patients. Resources:http",

The listener   says  very little but conveys empathy, acceptance and genuineness. The    listener only speaks to find out if a statement (or two or twenty) has    been correctly heard and understood.Active listening  (link to Introduction to Counselling Skills: Texts and Activities by Richard Nelson-Jones) is hard but rewarding work.  It is so tempting to interrupt, so easy to be distracted. So… 1.\tBefore the session, make sure your physical needs are taken care of (thirst, hunger, bathroom, stretching).2.\tLook at the speaker. Taking a few notes can keep you on task; mentally put masking tape across your mouth.3.\tWatch your body language! More on this later.4.\tEncourage the speaker to continue with short, gentle comments like “uh-huh”, “really!?”, “tell me more”, etc. If  the person is not normally talkative, you may have to refer to your  brief one or two word notes and ask an open question.  More on this  later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Class Homework - Active Listening Exercise: 10 minutes of active listening and 5 minutes of feedbackSpeaker  - You are to tell the listener all about something frustrating that  happened within the last week or so.  For example, being stuck in  traffic, the neighbor from hades, etc.  Listener - You are  not allowed to say anything more than two or three syllables long to  keep her/him continuing ie “uh-huh”, really!?”, “tell me more”, etc.   *****Listener1. Were you able to keep the conversation going using only encouraging body language and a word or two?2. Were you able to keep from interjecting?Speaker1. Did you feel you have permission to keep talking?2. Did you feel heard?You may have found that this felt somewhat fake.  Don’t worry – it was a created situation!  Now, reverse roles! ***** Out of Class HomeworkBe very conscious of how well you listen. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA good listener is not only popular everywhere, but after a while he knows something. - Wilson Mizner\n\n\n\n\nBuy  at AllPosters.com\n\n\n\n\ntake me to the top of the page!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This is true regardless of income, health, age and  attractiveness.  Or so say the people who study the science of  happiness.The following is an excerpt from the article \"Are You Happy?\" in \"The Independent.”  The full version can be found at   http://www.independent.co.uk \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn How to Be Happier \n\nCan you learn to be happy? With 13 million prescriptions a year  written for new-generation anti-depressants in Britain, this is no  longer a question just for philosophers. Neuroscientists, sociologists,  economists and public policy experts are increasingly focusing on the  nature of happiness, and how to increase it. Positive psychology, a new  school at the cutting edge of the discipline, claims that not only can  science identify the components of a happy life, but also that we can  all \"learn\" how to be happier.  Earlier this year, in the biggest social experiment of its  kind, six happiness experts from these various disciplines took on a  daunting task: to make the people of the Berkshire town of Slough  happier. They worked with 50 volunteers, attempting to raise their  capacity for joy through a programme of experiments and community-based  activities - everything from workplace counselling to meditation in a  graveyard (awareness of death makes all of us keen not to waste life)  and a smile campaign. The results will be screened next month on BBC2 in  the series Making Slough Happy.The volunteers were a mixed bag,  including a DJ, a landscape designer and a teacher. Slough was chosen  because it is such a multicultural community (and possibly because of  Ricky Gervais's The Office). The volunteers' happiness levels ranged  from people who had battled serious depression to those who considered  themselves averagely happy. They worked to a manifesto of 12 points  similar to the ones shown here, drawn up by the experts, who included  the Radio 2 psychotherapist Brett Kahr and Dr Richard Stevens, former  head of psychology at the Open University...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPositive Psychology\n\nPositive psychology - or the science of happiness - emerged in the US  in the late 1990s. It turned the traditional discipline on its head by  focusing on how people flourish rather than how they become depressed.  In the past the goal was to bring patients from a negative state to a  neutral normal. Positive psychologists believe they can increase our  happiness by identifying and using many traits we already possess -  kindness, originality, humour. Underpinning all of this is a new consensus that our capacity for  happiness is not dominated by our genetic inheritance and our  experiences before the age of five. In fact, these factors contribute  only around 50 per cent to our happiness potential. The rest is under  our control. The brain can be \"programmed\" for a higher base level of  happiness using techniques such as fast-forward thinking (where you  screen \"a film\" of a negative event faster and faster in your mind until  it dissolves) and cultivating \"flow\" activities. These are hobbies or  skills where we completely forget about time and are most uniquely  ourselves (as in \"in the flow\") - anything from cooking to rock  climbing.Very happy people, psychologists say, are more sociable and  more agreeable than the average, but otherwise they are not particularly  extraordinary. They are neither more beautiful nor more successful than  the rest of us, and they do not appear to have more pleasurable life  experiences. If you want to be like them you need to pinpoint exactly  what makes you happy and incorporate more of it into your life.And  that doesn't mean asking for a pay rise. Once our basic material needs  have been met, additional money and status have little effect on  reported levels of happiness. (Researchers found virtually the same  level of happiness between the very rich on the Forbes 400 list and  Masai herdsmen. The reason for this is that the human brain becomes  conditioned to positive experiences.) Nor do youth, education or a high  IQ contribute to happiness. Illness doesn't exclude you from happiness: a  US study found that more than 80 per cent of people who were paralysed  in all four limbs considered their life to be above average in terms of  happiness. They could enjoy their meals, their friends, watch the news.  The factors that reflect most strongly in surveys, over and over again,  are family, community and trust in fellow human beings...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiving Living \n\nGiving is a clear road to happiness. The founding father of positive  psychology, Martin Seligman, has identified three distinct components of  happiness: - the pleasant life (a glass of wine), - the good life (work, romance, hobbies) and   - the meaningful life (using personal strengths in the service of  something larger than you, such as politics, religion or community  action). All contribute to wellbeing but it is the meaningful  life that is the key to long-term joy. Without it, sooner or later, you  will look in the mirror and ask, \"Is this all there is?\"Work on  your mind. ... [R]eframing - learning to recognise and dispute  pessimistic thoughts - takes practice. Research shows that it takes 21  days to create a new habit pathway in the brain, and a further 63 days  to consolidate what you have learnt. It sounds corny, but the other  mantra of positive psychology is to count your blessings. Make a  deliberate attempt at least once a day to reflect on some of the good  things in your life and your brain will become happier. Stop comparing. In the West, what sociologists call \"reference  anxiety\" has become a disease. We constantly compare what we have with  others and find what we have wanting. Start looking at people who have  less instead of more. Olympic bronze medallists have been shown to be  happier than silver medallists - they have got into the top three rather  than just missed the top slot. Sometimes positive psychology sounds like the art of the blindingly  obvious. Be nice to people and they'll be nice back. Count your  blessings. But it works. The simple truth is people who care about  others are happier than those who are more preoccupied with themselves.  As Slough volunteer Graeme Nash observes, \"There's one thing that's  equal to all of us: and that's the amount of time we have available.  We've got to make sure that 15 minutes, 30 minutes, an hour a day is  spent on some sort of positive action, connecting with the community  around us. You can't just sit back and wait for the knock on the door  for happiness to walk in. You've got to go out and find it.\"\"How to Be Happy: Lessons from Making Slough Happy\" by Liz Hoggard is published by BBC Books. \n\n\n\n\nBooks and Video \nBooks \"How to Be Happy Everyday By the Happiest Man in America\" by J.

This is a \"must watch.\"  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo \n\n\n\nQuotes From Randy Pausch’s Last Lecture \nWe cannot change the cards we are dealt, just how we play the hand.Have something to bring to the table, because that will make you more welcome.I probably got more from that dream and not accomplishing it than I got from any of the ones that I did accomplish.You’ve got to get the fundamentals down because otherwise the fancy stuff isn’t going to work.When  you see yourself doing something badly and nobody’s bothering to tell  you anymore, that’s a very bad place to be. Your critics are your ones  telling you they still love you and care.Experience is what you  get when you didn’t get what you wanted.The brick walls are not there to  keep us out. The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how  badly we want something. Because the brick walls are there to stop the  people who don’t want it badly enough. It’s very important to know when you’re in a pissing match. And it’s very important to get out of it as quickly as possible.If  you’re going to do anything that pioneering you will get those arrows  in the back, and you just have to put up with it. I mean everything that  could go wrong did go wrong.Somewhere along the way there’s got  to be some aspect of what lets you get to achieve your dreams. First one  is the role of parents, mentors, and students.You just have to decide if you’re a Tigger or an Eeyore.I  have a theory that people who come from large families are better  people because they’ve just had to learn to get along.Loyalty is a two  way street.You can’t get there alone. People have to help you and  I do believe in karma. I believe in paybacks. You get people to help  you by telling the truth. Being earnest.I’ll take an earnest person over a hip person every day, because hip is short term. Earnest is long term.Apologise when you screw up and focus on other people, not on yourself.Don’t bail. The best of the gold’s at the bottom of barrels of crap.Get  a feedback loop and listen to it. Your feedback loop can be this dorky  spreadsheet thing I did, or it can just be one great man who tells you  what you need to hear. The hard part is the listening to it.Don’t  complain. Just work harder. That’s a picture of Jackie Robinson. It was  in his contract not to complain, even when the fans spit on him.Be good at something, it makes you valuable.Find  the best in everybody. Just keep waiting no matter how long it takes.  No one is all evil. Everybody has a good side, just keep waiting, it  will come out.Be prepared. Luck is truly where preparation meets  opportunity.It’s not about how to achieve your dreams. It’s about how to  lead your life. If you lead your life the right way, the karma will  take care of itself. The dreams will come to you.\n\n\n\n\nBuy  at AllPosters.com\n\n\n\n\ntake me to the top of this page!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\nPhotos from (vincent desjardins), hope_art\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Neuroscientists, sociologists,  economists and public policy experts are increasingly focusing on the  nature of happiness, and how",

Positive psychology, a new  school at the cutting edge of the discipline, claims that not only can  science identify the components of a happy life, but also that we can  all \"learn\" how to be happier.  Earlier this year, in the biggest social experiment of its  kind, six happiness experts from these various disciplines took on a  daunting task: to make the people of the Berkshire town of Slough  happier. They worked with 50 volunteers, attempting to raise their  capacity for jo",

Slough was chosen  because it is such a multicultural community (and possibly because of  Ricky Gervais's The",

In the past the goal was to bring patients from a negative state to a  neutral normal.

Underpinning all of this is a new consensus that our capacity for  happiness is not dominated by our genetic inheritance and our  exper",

The brain can be \"programmed\" for a higher base level of  happiness using techniques such as fast-forward thinking (where you  screen \"a film\" of a negative event faster and faster in your mind until  it dissolves) and cultivating \"flow\" activities. These are hobbies or  skills where we completely forget about time and are most uniquely  ourselves ",

Nowadays, skin conditions are very common. The most common one is acne. The increase in pollution is one of the major reasons for the increase in these skin conditions. But we can’t blame everything on pollution. People follow many lifestyle habits which result in skin damage. Lifestyle Habits That Can Cause Skin DamagePeople intentionally or unintentionally choose to follow some lifestyle habits which affect the skin. This blog post intends to make people understand how their habits will damage the skin permanently. Here are 5 common lifestyle habits that can cause skin damage: SmokingNot Using SunscreenImproper Face WashingGoing Ham on SugarPicking Acne SmokingSmoking is generally bad for health. As we all know, smoking causes cancer. But it doesn’t stop with cancer alone. It can cause multiple health hazards. The thing is, smoking doesn’t have any kind of benefits. People who smoke are doing it only because of addiction. A smoker's skin will not heal properly when wounded. Nicotine will damage the skin by reducing the blood flow to the skin. It also damages collagen and elastin. If you are a smoker, consider quitting. Not Using SunscreenProlonged sun exposure is one of the primary reasons for getting skin conditions like acne. While the idea of being exposed to the sun feels nice, it is not always good for your skin health. Some people apply sunscreen only when they go out on beaches, but it is good to apply sunscreen even on normal days. When using sunscreens, see if it has at least an SPF of 30. Always use sunscreens that has over 30 SPF. Discuss with your skin care provider to know which sunscreen will suit your skin. Improper Face WashingYes, washing your face can impact your skin health. Washing your face is not wrong, but over-washing or under-washing may have some unwarranted outcomes. People sometimes wash their faces whenever they can in a day. They feel that washing their face more often is good. But in reality, washing your face more than twice is not good. Washing your face more will result in damaging the skin. Washing the face multiple times will make the skin dry. To repair, the skin will produce excessive sebum, which will clog the pore and will result in acne. So, be sure not to wash your face too often. Washing your face less than twice is also bad since the face will remain oily. Going Ham on SugarLet’s be honest; we all love sugar. Sugar makes everything better other than our skin. And also diabetes. While sugar tastes good, it is not advisable to intake too much sugar. Sugar is the primary reason for many health conditions. In addition, it can also damage your skin. You can eat sugar, but if you want to protect your skin, eat some vegetables too. Picking AcneAcne is a very common skin condition. Many people have it all around the world. Most people try to pick acne. They treat it too harshly. Acne shouldn’t be picked or poked. It should be gently treated. If you pick acne, it can result in acne scars. Acne scars will not heal completely. Nevertheless, cities like Chennai face heavy heat in the summer, so cover your face or apply sunscreen before going outside. If you have a severe condition, you should consult with a skin specialist in Chennai or anywhere near you instead of picking it. Wrapping UpIf you have skin conditions, do not panic. You are not alone. Skin conditions are very normal, and mostly it is not fatal. Try to follow the above tips to protect yourself from skin conditions. If you do get it, consult a skin doctor. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

However, what you may not know is that one of the simplest solutions for better mental health is something you should be doing every single night: getting restful sleep. Improving your quality of sleep can vastly improve the way you think and feel. So, use these simple tricks to get more of the sleep you need. Buying a New Mattress Can Boost Your Brain If you want to make a solid investment in your mental health, you should think about investing in a new mattress. When an old mattress is messing with your sleep, you are more likely to react poorly to emotional situations, and you may even find symptoms of depression and anxiety getting worse. To keep your brain sharp and your emotions in check, try shopping for a mattress that will allow you to get the seven to eight hours of rest your mind needs every night. Do some research online, and use mattress buying guides to find reviews of the best mattresses on the market. Even if you experience back pain, are a hot sleeper, or sleep in various positions, you should be able to find a mattress that benefits your sleep and therefore your mental health. Getting More Sleep Can Lead to Less Stress Two factors that can influence your health the most are sleep and stress. So, it comes as no surprise that sleep and stress are closely connected. When you are not getting enough sleep, feelings of stress will become more intense and have more of an impact on your body and your mind. Studies show that chronic stress can lead to more problems with anxiety and depression. Stress can even make mood disorders and other mental health issues worse. However, sleep can impact mental health as well, so to reduce potential stress and mental health issues, start by improving your sleep routine. Try some nighttime calming techniques, such as purposed breathing, positive thinking, or a warm bath, to help you drift off to sleep. Reducing Chronic Pain Creates More Happiness If you are suffering from chronic pain, you are dealing with so much more than the physical effects. Chronic pain is linked with isolation and depression, and sleep deprivation can make both depression and pain worse. If you are sleeping on an old mattress, pain in your muscles and joints may be more severe and getting rest can be impossible. Even with a new mattress, poor sleep hygiene can heighten pain and health problems. To protect yourself from more pain, and subsequent mental health issues, try creating a sleep sanctuary in your bedroom. Keep things dark, cool, and quiet. If you do need a little noise, try a fan or sound machine instead of keeping a television or laptop in your bedroom. If your chronic pain is keeping you from getting rest, think about talking to your doctor about medications that can help. Habits That Support Sleep Support Mental Health Too  This may surprise, you but your daytime routines can have just as much impact on your sleep as what you do at night. Exercise, diet, and self-care all play a crucial role in preparing your body for rest at night and maintaining optimal mental health. When you work out, your brain is better able to produce endorphins that help keep your body calm and your mind happy throughout the day. Some research suggests that morning exercise can even make you sleep better and improve how you feel during the day too. Food is also a big factor in your sleep and health. Consuming a diet of processed, sugary foods will leave you sluggish and can even lead to health problems that are more severe than drugs or alcohol. So, make sure you get enough exercise each day, maintain a healthy diet, and take some time to relax and practice self-care. Taking care of your mental health doesn’t require a lot of effort. With a few basic steps, you can improve the way you sleep and improve your mental health in the process. So, take control of your happiness by taking control of your sleep habits. Photo Credit: Unsplash\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Mitchell\nWhen life starts to get hectic, self-care is one of the first things that can fall on the back burner. Sometimes, it’s easy to forget that taking care of yourself should actually be your main priority. Additionally, the thought of getting your life back on track can be overwhelming. Luckily, it doesn’t have to be. Establishing a positive journal routine is a great way to help you stay healthy and take care of your own needs. Here are a few tips to help you establish a daily journal routine and tend to your mental health, once and for all.1. Schedule the time beforehandChoosing a time frame is the first step to beginning a journal routine in your day-to-day life. Unfortunately, setting aside time in your calendar can be a challenge—especially when things are busy. However, it’s important to make this a priority in your daily routine. This routine doesn’t need to be a huge time commitment. It could be 15–20 minutes at the end of the day. Find what works with your schedule and designate that time for your journal routine. 2. Understand what your journaling goals areBefore starting your journal routine, you should try to map out what you hope to get out of the practice. This will help determine what you should include in the routine and will remind you of why you’re doing it. For example, if your goal is to stop taking things for granted, you could include what you’re grateful for everyday and reflect on what’s going well. If you’re goal is to keep track of your weight loss goals, you could keep track of your progress every day. 3. Choose the place and remove distractionsThere’s nothing worse than being stressed out in the morning because you’re rushing to get ready. Preparing the night before can help cut down on morning anxiety by making sure everything you need is already laid out for you. This can mean getting your clothes ready, making your lunch, and packing your bag for work or school.Your home should be a peaceful place where you can easily rest and relax. Noises and distractions, such as clutter, dirty carpets, and noisy appliances can have the opposite effect on your well-being. Take care of home repairs, organize your belongings, and clean your carpets to help create a space that incentivizes healthy habits. There’s nothing more detrimental to routine than living reactively to everything around you. When you’re proactive, you can take care of things before they cause stress.   4. Get on a healthy sleep schedule It’s easy to trick yourself into thinking that you can get only a few hours of sleep each night and be fine. Keep in mind that even if you feel alright in the moment, you could cause unseen damage to your mental and physical health. If you’re inconsistent with something as simple as your sleep schedule, it’s unlikely that you’ll keep up with a journal routine. Try to get a healthy amount of sleep every night so that you give your body and brain the time it needs to recharge. Doing so will also help you get used to doing something on a routine basis. 5. Focus on consistency, not perfectionResearch has shown that keeping a routine can have a positive impact on your mental health. Finding the routine that works for you can help establish consistency in your daily life and give your mental health a boost. The important thing to remember when starting out is that you’re not striving for perfection. The sole purpose is to benefit you—if you miss a day or have short entries sometimes, that’s perfectly normal.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Treatment through medication, counseling and therapy are common and important ways to manage anxiety, but supplementing your treatment with tools like journaling can be a valuable way of helping you to manage your anxiety as well. With several journaling mediums to choose from — including video and writing — here’s how each can present a worthy self-help solution, as well as a helpful addition to your routine. How documentation can help Documenting your anxiety via journaling not only helps you to effectively record your growth over a long period of time, but it can also help you to calm your mind, let go of negative thoughts, and allow you to explore your experiences with anxiety. Documenting your anxiety through journaling also brings an effective and insightful way of letting your emotions out, and helps in organizing your thoughts so that you can better analyze them. James Pennebaker, a researcher, who studied the impact of writing on HIV patients, noted that “By writing, you put some structure and organization to those anxious feelings. It helps you get past them.” In turn, this can allow you to process your emotions more easily. The benefits of keeping a physical journal Writing out your feelings in a journal or notebook allows you to privately and productively get your thoughts out, allowing you to express and relieve your anxiety in the process. One way to document your anxiety through journaling is by maintaining a bullet journal, which will allow you to express yourself creatively with a totally blank canvas. Furthermore, a bullet journal may be particularly beneficial with insightful tasks like keeping track of your anxiety-related behaviors, such as panic attacks, which allows you to better monitor your anxiety in an organized and easy to view manner. By making journaling a daily habit, this gives you a concrete record of how you’re feeling on any given day, which is beneficial in looking back and identifying triggers, and working from there to further manage and understand your anxiety. Finding a community with vlogging Digital journaling through vlogging is another great way to document your anxiety, allowing you to explore your feelings and relieve your symptoms. For example, vlogging will allow you the freedom to talk out loud about your anxiety triggers and related symptoms like panic attacks, and presents the option of uploading the videos to a public platform such as YouTube. Millennials view an average of 12.1 hours per week of video: it is clear that there is an audience to connect with, allowing you to share your experiences with others and see that you’re not alone. By ensuring that your content is fully accessible through using features like captions or subtitles, you can widen your reach by including those who may be hearing impaired, or those who might not speak your language fluently. This makes it even more likely that your videos will find your tribe: people who can relate to your experiences with anxiety. Managing anxiety is not an easy task, but documenting it can help to make things easier. Whether you choose to journal, vlog or both, you can reap the many benefits that documenting your anxiety brings, including the ability to identify triggers and look back at your growth over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

A disheveled home is difficult to navigate and obstructs the kind of free-flow that is essential to environmental balance. Messes irritate us on all sorts of levels, so we often avoid dealing with them until some imaginary later time when we think we’ll be less stressed. And then that time never materializes. There’s good news, though. Cleaning is actually a great way to de-stress, and it’s a lot easier than you might think. Messes can make us tense Our homes are supposed to be sanctuaries from some of life’s problems. Work woes, intrapersonal issues, and gripes with the outside world can all be left outside your front door, in theory. But in practice, we can let all of these in when we allow our homes to become dumping grounds rather than serene shelters. Messes make us feel anxious and helpless, overwhelm us with stimuli and laden us with guilt about our cleanliness. Worse, clutter and the bad feelings we associate with it takes up too much space in our mind. Instead of being creative, solving problems or just enjoying life, we worry and fret over dust bunnies and piles of stuff. Imagine the possibilities if you achieved your clean house goal. Minimize stress by attacking mess The act of cleaning, on its own, is a stress cure. There is a meditative quality to housework, especially when added to a routine. It can even be fun as well, where you can listen to your favorite music or even dance a little for some exercise. And the process of cleaning relieves stress directly because you are eliminating a source of stress -- your messy house! Alternatively, the act of decluttering can seem stressful. That’s because clutter is less of a physical problem and more of a mental challenge. The reasons we hold onto too much stuff vary from fear to guilt to pride. The good news is that anyone can learn to declutter. Most expert suggests separating items into keep, sell, donate, and trash. If there are items you just can’t decide about, box them up and put them in storage for six months; then go back and look at them again. To prevent cluttering up your home with boxes, consider renting an off-site storage unit as an investment in your peace of mind. Tips to effective and efficient cleaning Much of the stress over clutter is because we fear that the mess is insurmountable. If we arm ourselves with some professional cleaning tips, we can tackle messes as they arise and realize some additional side benefits, as well. Here are some techniques to speed up your path to serenity:The grid approach. Rather than inefficiently roaming from room to room picking up messes haphazardly, break your living space down into chunks. This technique uses the age-old wisdom of breaking your problems down into little pieces and provides structure for a cleaning plan.Top to bottom. While cleaning your sections, always work from top to bottom. This avoids duplicative work that could result if dust from above rained down on a freshly mopped floor, for example.Keep tools stocked and available. Organizing your cleaning tools will save considerable time when you clean. With the right supplies at the ready, you’ll have the right tool for the job and can clean efficiently.Clean as you go. Resist the temptation to put off cleaning. Messes fester and become more difficult to clean. Stains set it, and dust can cling to grease in the kitchen, but not if you wipe surfaces as part of a daily routine.  By cleaning efficiently and as you go, you can avoid having to bring in outside help, which can be costly (maid services cost $164 on average in Green Valley). Look for hidden spots that make your home shine Some areas collect more dust and grime than others, such as hard surface flooring, behind appliances and baseboards. A daily habit of sweeping or dust-mopping can reduce visible dirt and mess (a quality dust mop will run you around $12). And baseboards only require monthly attention in most cases. Here are some tips to make these spots shine:Attack the loose soil first. Use a vacuum with a brush attachment. It’s much easier to clean up dry material - like dust and hair - before using wet cleaners.Sponge it down. There are a few tactics to employ in wiping down the baseboards. You can simply crouch down with a wet sponge, or you can use a sponge mop from a standing position.De-static the baseboard. Once clean and dry, go back over the baseboard with a dryer sheet. It will remove any static on the surface, which will repel dust.  Good cleaning habits and a few pro tips can help you maintain your home as a sanctuary for you and your family. Calmness, productivity and enjoyment await - it’s as easy as grabbing a broom. Photo Credit: Pexels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The current business culture is ready for fresh ideas and growth if you know how to lay a proper foundation. Here is how to set up your business, and yourself, for success.  Getting Into the Gig Economy Are you looking for something a little adventurous that lands on the side of alternative employment?  As Harvard Business Review points out, the gig economy is a land of opportunity for those seeking a venture that offers freedom and independence. Think about things you’re passionate about and what existing skills you offer. It’s a chance to do freelance work or become an independent contractor, and you can get into an assortment of interesting occupations, such as freelance writing or dog walking. With dog walking, for example, you can establish your own hours and fees for services, and you can even decide for yourself what types of furry friends you handle. For those who love man’s best friend, it’s a terrific opportunity. Money Matters How will you fund your new venture? Some businesses require minimal initial financial outlay, but you still need to be able to cover some initial supplies, such as a computer, smartphone, transportation, and workspace. One idea is to bootstrap if your starting costs are low or you already earmarked a cache for your project. Bootstrapping offers an abundance of flexibility if you can swing it, but of course, it also could limit your progress by how much money you can dedicate to your project. Another suggestion is to reach out to friends and family or do some crowdfunding. By connecting with those close to you, people on social media, and anyone with an interest in the kind of endeavor you're taking on, you can use the outreach to begin building a customer base and drawing associates before you officially put up a shingle.  Prepare a Plan Making a business plan can mean all the difference in whether you achieve your goals. NerdWallet notes that without a properly prepared business plan, you won’t be able to qualify for any small business loans. On top of that, creating a business plan means framing your objectives in a clear manner so you know how you will get where you want to be. For instance, your plan should include a summary of what you’re doing, how your startup is organized, what you intend to offer, and projections of what income you can expect. You should also create a budget so your finances are organized and on track, right from the beginning.  Growing Your Customer Base No matter how terrific your idea is, without customers, you won’t be able to thrive. What’s more, it’s in your best interests to continually look for ways to expand your customer base. Expect to divide your time between your current customers and drawing new ones, and always offer terrific customer service so people have great things to say about you. Also, make sure you put some effort into networking with other business owners, members of the community, and connecting at industry-related events, as you never know what sort of opportunities you can find or create that will help your startup to grow.   Smart Marketing Strategies How you market your startup can greatly influence not only getting your name out there, but also how others see your work, and it doesn’t mean you need to invest in an expensive marketing firm. Reach out and connect with people and followers in a meaningful way. For instance, if you are opening a mobile pet grooming service, you can make uplifting comments on social media about people’s pets, share about shelter animals looking for homes, or post ads for owners looking for their lost pets. It’s a chance to build credibility as well as engagement.  Developing a startup can be the best thing you’ve ever accomplished. Embrace the challenge by thinking things through clearly and doing some smart outreach. Before you know it, your new venture will be successfully up and running!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

There are many reasons why anxiety rates are growing among the senior population; financial stress, side effects from medications, loss of independence, loss of loved ones, and in recent times, the threat of COVID-19. While anxiety disorders can significantly impact the functioning of older adults, they often go undiagnosed and untreated which eventually affects their physical health and overall quality of life. This is where you come in; if you are counseling a senior citizen, anxiety is one of the things that you must always be on the lookout for to ensure that they live out the remaining part of their life happily and without any worries. Getting to the root of the problem during therapy In many cases, seniors don't know that they have anxiety disorders and even when they know, some choose to keep it to themselves. To help them, you can start by checking for various symptoms of anxiety without directly asking them about it. Some of the symptoms include sweating, shortness of breath, dizziness, trembling, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. You may also ask them general questions about their lifestyle to know whether they are facing some of the risk factors associated with anxiety. For example, you can ask about their physical health, quality of sleep, medications they are taking, physical limitations in daily activities, and their history of alcohol or drug abuse. The answers to these questions will go a long way in helping you uncover the source of anxiety so that you can treat it. During therapy, it is important that you practice active listening to make the seniors feel more comfortable to speak freely about their woes. Helping seniors deal with anxiety Once you have determined that your patient has an anxiety disorder, it is up to you to explore various treatment options to find one or a combination of treatments that work. There are many treatment options for seniors facing anxiety, and the right approach for your patient will depend on various factors including the root cause of anxiety, their physical health, and their willingness to try it. The first treatment you can try is just talking it out with the senior during your therapy sessions. This involves encouraging them to express their fears, reassuring them that what they're feeling is normal and they can get over it, and reminding them that getting help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Another treatment option is to encourage your patient to make certain lifestyle changes to see if their symptoms improve. For example, you can encourage them to join a fitness class where they can engage in stress-relieving exercise and interact with other people, boosting their mental health. There are also various modern technologies that can help seniors combat anxiety, especially those who live alone at home. For example, you can encourage your patient to install smart cameras and sensors at home to keep them safe from various safety and security threats they could be feeling anxious about. Similarly, wearable health monitors can help seniors keep track of their physical health, alleviating anxiety arising out of health concerns. Communication and monitoring devices will also allow them to get in touch with friends, relatives, and medical professionals when they need to. As a last resort, certain medications can also be used to treat anxiety disorders. However, it's important to find out if they're taking any other medications so that you can make prescriptions appropriately. Everyone experiences anxiety from time to time, but when it becomes destructive to a senior's life, it's time to take it seriously. As a counselor, you can play your part by working with seniors to get to the root of the problem and offering treatment options that work for them. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

As well as being problematic for the economy, this is concerning as debt can have negative effects on your physical and mental health. A study from the University of Southampton found a correlation with debt and poor mental health. However, if your friend is in debt trouble and and you recommend counseling then they will probably immediately say, “Counseling costs money! When the source of my stress is money-related, how will spending more help?” Luckily, there are services that offer training in counseling skills, for free or cheap. These skills can help you address debt issues, for yourself or someone close to you. Read on for more information on debt and counseling. The mental impact of debt Regardless of the cause, stress can have a big impact on your health, both physical and mental. Financial stress can cause headaches, insomnia, unhealthy eating habits and increased susceptibility to infections. Often, seniors experience significant financial stress, more than other demographics, because their bodies are less able to repair and adapt themselves. However old you are, left unchecked, financial stress can lead to more long term conditions such as anxiety, depression and chronic health conditions. When it gets to this point, an intervention becomes necessary: this intervention can be counseling.Self-help counseling For those who are otherwise mentally healthy and think that their financial woes are probably the main cause of your stress and anxiety, self-help counselling could be a great way to deal with financial stress. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or CBT techniques can help change negative thinking patterns surrounding your debt, as well as help you become more organized - very useful in managing your money. If you’re not ready for that, simple journaling can be a wonderful outlet, allowing you to release your emotions, freeing up your mind to make changes. Finally, setting yourself regular and realistic financial goals and meeting them will increase your confidence.​Everyone is different and different solutions will help your unique problem. But for many people, learning counseling techniques for self-help can be an effective strategy to tackle financial stress. As much of this study is free or cheap and can be done by yourself without complicated technology, why not give it a try?  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In addition to feeling fearful or apprehensive, an anxious person often experiences self-doubt in their ability to cope with the imagined threat or worst-case scenario. Physical symptoms include built-up tension in muscles, increased perspiration, and heightened heart rate. The first thing you should know if you suffer from anxiety is that you’re not alone. In fact, anxiety affects 40 million adults—or 18.1% of the population—in the US, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. Fortunately, anxiety is treatable by therapy and medication but, most importantly, perspective. Anxious people can work on redirecting their anxiety without guidance or a prescription by becoming more aware of these hypothetical situations they worry about and by coming back to the present moment. Here are several practical solutions to three common fears, so you can stop worrying and start living.Your HealthHealthcare has been the most common concern among Americans for the third year in a row now. 55% of Americans reported worrying “a great deal” about the availability and affordability of healthcare, according to a national survey conducted earlier this year. Unfortunately, healthcare reform takes years and there’s never a universal solution that can ease everyone’s minds. However, leaving your anxiety to brew for that long won’t help your health either. Anxiety can cause additional health problems like panic attacks, shallow breathing, fatigue, and a multitude of aches and pains from headaches to an upset stomach. It can also hijack your mood, lead to depression, and affect your sex drive. Here are some ways you can take ownership of your health and protect your well-being:Move more—I hesitate to prescribe “exercise” in this article because exercise and fitness can also be a cause for anxiety in itself. We’re all busy and it can be difficult to fit in a full-body workout on a regular basis. Instead, I suggest simply moving more often, which could be as easy as stretching in the morning while your coffee brews, taking the stairs at work, or walking the dog in the evening.Eat better—Diet changes should be made in moderation. Jumping aboard a fad diet bandwagon will inevitably lead to burnout and cause you more anxiety that’s rooted in the feeling of failure. Reflect on your diet and take a closer look at your pantry. Next time you make a grocery list, include more produce and less packaged snacks.Sleep well—The exact amount of sleep an individual needs varies, but seven hours is the new eight, according to a report in the Archives of General Psychiatry. Your HomeAsk any homeowner and they’ll give you a laundry list of worries they have. Three “big” ones—yet solvable problems—include finances, unexpected home projects, and home security. Here are three action items you can do today to ease your mind:Shift your search--Seven of 10 millennials fear it will be difficult for them to get a mortgage and 9% have given up their search for a home altogether. These hopeful home buyers may be going at their search the wrong way though. Instead of focusing on what you can’t afford, figure out what you can afford. Dave Ramsey, suggests calculating your income, living expenses, and prospective homeownership costs and adjusting your budget accordingly. If you’re worried about affording a down payment, you could qualify for an FHA loan with a down payment as low as 3.5%. You may also need to start house hunting in a new city. Huntsville, Alabama was recognized as the most affordable place to live in 2018, but here are 24 more cities to explore.Home protection plans—Homeowners are required to have home insurance, which will cover your house and personal belongings in the case of theft or disaster. This should ease your mind from hypothetical situations like fires and burglaries. However, home insurance does not cover more common, everyday problems like broken appliances. This winter, you may be worrying about your 19-year-old water heater breaking. How will you afford to fix it? Will you have to bathe your children in cold water? In these cases, homeowners can enjoy peace of mind by investing in a home warranty, which covers the repair and replacement costs of major appliances and systems.Technology you can trust—One-third of Americans expect to feel anxious about the security of their home this holiday season, according to the latest Travel Mindfulness Report. The survey suggests smart home technology, like a smart lighting control system, may be the answer to these worries. If you can afford to invest in a new alarm system or the latest technological device, then consider the extra security as money well-spent. If you’re strapped for extra cash, you can go the tried-and-true route of knocking on a neighbor’s door, giving them your contact information, and letting them know when you’ll be back. Another option is to hire a house sitter through a secure platform.​Your MoneyYou—along with 99% of us—wonder how we’ll afford this or that and when we’ll finally get out of debt on top of all the other what-if’s that crop up. I’m no financial advisor and I’m drowning in student loan debt myself, but I’ve found my way over the hump of hopelessness and used the three strategies to cope with my money worries:Reality-based budgeting—You can beat yourself up all day about how much money you think you should save, but it’s much more effective—and encouraging—to budget based on how much you can save. I made a wallet-changing discovery after college by calculating how much I spent in the past three months and what I spent it on. I used those eye-opening numbers to allocate realistic percentages of my monthly income to three major categories: essential living expenses (rent or mortgage, utilities, transportation, and groceries), personal choices (clothes, restaurants, gifts, etc.), and debt (student loans and credit card payments). After six months of budgeting this way, I was able to afford a fourth category—savings.Baby steps away from debt--Debt—be it student loans, credit card, or past due bills—is overwhelming. Most of us can’t just pay off a loan by saving for a few months and writing a check. However, a lot of us can benefit from focusing on one bill at a time. The first step is the hardest—listing your debts from least to greatest. You’ll have to continue making minimum payments on all of these debts except for the smallest one, which you’ll pay off as much as possible. As soon as the smallest debt is paid, you’ll get some hard-earned relief and you’ll be able to roll that old monthly payment over to the next smallest debt. Dave Ramsey calls this The Snowball Method.Invest in the present--Anyone can worry about what the future holds. You can worry about getting a flat tire on the way home from work today and you can worry about your house catching on fire one day. You can anticipate the oven breaking on Thanksgiving, losing your job, or never affording your dream house. However, you—and only you—hold all of the power to put these anxieties and the million other worries you construct on a daily basis to rest.

You’ll have to continue making minimum payments on all of these debts except for the smallest one, which you’ll pay off as much as possible. As soon as the smallest debt is paid, you’ll get some hard-earned relief and you’ll be able to roll that old monthly payment over to the next smallest debt. Dave Ramsey calls this The Snowbal",

This fact alone shows the desperate need for effective stress management techniques in today’s society. In addition to using effective counseling techniques, it is essential to know more about today’s top counseling strategies for quickly reducing stress.If you are looking to learn more about how to empower your clients with stress management tools, explore three of the most effective strategies.Deep breathing exercisesThe majority of the time, people experience stress while away from home. Whether at work or traveling for business, feelings of anxiety and tension are never convenient. That is why it is crucial to give people techniques for reducing stress levels on-the-go. One subtle technique that can be used anywhere is deep breathing. During periods of high stress, many individuals forget to breathe normally, which only worsens the problem. Taking regular, controlled deep breaths can reduce muscle tension, clear one’s thinking, and help reduce overall anxiety. To teach your clients how to breathe deeply, instruct them to sit comfortably in a chair, and to breathe through their nose (expanding the belly) for several seconds. They should then slowly exhale through the nose, while trying to squeeze all air out. Repeating these steps several times until stress levels have subsided is recommended.Positive affirmationsPositive affirmations are statements that an individual can say to him or herself at any time to help foster a positive mindset (and as a result, decrease overall stress levels). The goal of these statements is to drive out negative thoughts and self-talk that commonly occur during times of high stress. These affirmations can be repeated to oneself as a stress preventative at the start of the day, or while experiencing a tense situation. Another key component of an effective affirmation is to word it in the present tense, and not as a goal of a future behavior. For example, good positive affirmations to use with your clients are “I handle all things calmly and easily,” and “I am relaxed and happy.”Mindfulness and meditationPerhaps two of the strongest emerging stress management techniques are mindfulness and meditation. Researchers have proven that meditation can reduce blood pressure, decrease pain, enhance decision making abilities, and calm feelings of stress. Additionally, mindfulness (the practice of being aware of one’s present thoughts in a non-judgmental way) can also reduce stress levels, enhance creativity, and help boost self-confidence through acceptance of the self. To encourage your clients to use these practices, there are now several excellent mindfulness and meditation apps available at no cost. You can also find guided meditation and mindfulness sessions for free on YouTube.​A major part of helping individuals cope with stress and anxiety is giving them the tools to thrive outside of counseling sessions. By empowering individuals with deep breathing exercises, positive affirmations, mindfulness, and meditation, you can provide long-lasting help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

(The link is to Essentials for Health and Wellness By Gordon Edlin, Eric Golanty, Kelli McCormack Brown.)*****“Founder”: George L. Engels (1913-1999)“…  nothing will change unless or until those who control resources have  the wisdom to venture off the beaten path of exclusive reliance on  biomedicine as the only approach to health care\". – G. L. Engels*****I  agree with this and maintain we have physical, intellectual, social,  emotional, vocational and spiritual needs - the neglect of which reduces  the ability of one to withstand the effects of stress. And we live in socio-economic conditions that can enhance or demean our long-term well-being.In  Holistic or Biopsychosoical (BPS) counseling a counselor does a  “whole-health” inventory which is much more thorough than the initial  intake. This would not likely be done in the first session because it is  very directional and therefore doesn’t give the client the opportunity  to talk about what she / he wants to address.Here is an outline of the whole-health inventory I use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Well Being – the Biopsycho part of Holistic Health or BPS \n\nPHYSICAL•\tNutrition •\t“anti-nutrition” including alcohol, junk food, caffeine and nicotine consumption•\tSleep •\tExercise • \tCheck in with Dr/NP (weight, blood pressure, blood work including  hemoglobin, cholesterol and blood sugar levels, and thyroid functioning)SOCIAL – Relationships with…•\tPartner•\tFriends•\tParents or Guardians•\tChildren or Dependents EMOTIONAL•\tPersonal time or “down-time”•\tHobbies •\tGood sense of humorSPIRITUALITY•\tThat which gives meaning to one's life and draws one to transcend oneself. •\tVolunteeringINTELLECTUAL •\tOur brains need regular and diverse stimulation. OCCUPATIONAL •\tWe thrive on meaningful, paying work. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial – Economic Well Being – the Social part of Holistic Health or BPS \nBASIC NEEDS•\tFood security – always has groceries•\tClothing – especially in northern climates•\tShelter – safe pleasant housing•\tAccess to health care including dental, vision, hearing, dietary, etc.CAREGIVING AND EDUCATION•\tChild care or elder care•\tEducation INCOME•\tIncome – over the poverty line•\tJob securityCOMMUNITY LIFE•\tSafe recreational areas including parks, pools, hiking trails•\tA valued role in the family, work and community.EQUAL OPPORTUNITY•\tCulture / race – addressing possible discrimination•\tGender / sexual orientation – discriminationYou can find easy to use forms at:  http://wholehealthcheckin.weebly.com/personal-health-overview.html http://wholehealthcheckin.weebly.com/social-health-overview.html*****Would a counselor use  every part of the holistic health list for every person? No.  And even  with those people for whom a whole health inventory is done, a counselor  would be more likely to check the “Personal Well Being” list since  these are things that the client has the capacity to modify (personal  empowerment.) Achieving positive change in “Social-Economic”  variables is very often beyond the client’s control. The counselor’s  role in this situation may be one of advocacy – helping the client get  access to services that she/he might normally not have access to, or  even know exist!\n\n\n\nFurther Reading and Videos \n BooksHolistic Health   \"The Biopsychosocial Approach: Past, Present and Future\"  by Frankel, Quill, and McDaniel, Boydell & Brewer, 2003Social Determinants \"Social Justice is Good for Our Hearts:  Why Societal Factors Not Lifestyles are Major Causes of Heart Disease  in Canada and Elsewhere\" by Dennis Raphael, Centre for Social Justice,  2002 VideosThe opening to “Supersize Me”  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8cAbWh4ZA   Tony Benn bonus interview from \"Sicko\"   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-2h0o3uZ-8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere a great proportion of the people are suffered to languish in helpless misery, that country must be ill-policed and wretchedly governed: a decent provision for the poor is the true test of civilization. - Dr. Samuel Johnson, 1770\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy  at AllPosters.com\n\n\n\n\nTAKE ME TO THE TOP OF THIS PAGE!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

These are admirable qualities, but unfortunately, they often leave little time for self-care. These tips from Basic Counseling Skills can help you support your hustle and your mental and physical health simultaneously. 1. Prioritize Sleep Sleep is often the first thing to go when you're busy making career moves. However, lack of sleep could be the one thing stopping you from reaching your goals. Research shows that getting enough sleep can improve your memory and help with creativity. Start by organizing your schedule and adhering to it as rigidly as possible. Remind yourself to stay on track because the meeting with your bed is just as important as a meeting with an investor. To be your best, you should be well-rested. 2. Start Your Day With Meditation Starting your day with mediation allows you to begin with intention. Designate an area in your home with no distractions. It could be a corner in the spare bedroom or a space on the back porch. Go there every morning before you start your day and take at least five minutes of meditation to start. You can build on that over time. 3. Exercise and Eat Well Taking care of your physical health is a great form of self-care. This can mean signing up for a gym membership or just going for a walk everything to clear your mind and burn calories. Be mindful of what you eat as well. For example, processed foods can make you feel sluggish and cause anxiety. Stick to nutrient-dense options, such as fruits, vegetables, and lean meats. 4. Make Wise Investments in your Business Hire staff to handle the tedious daily tasks so you can focus on things that make your business grow. For example, you'll finally have the time for LLC registration and take advantage of all the benefits. You don't have to pay the hefty lawyer fees to get it done. Just go online and use a formation service. You should get all the information on your state's regulations. Besides staff, another sound investment for growing your business is in digital marketing. Social media sites like Facebook are great places to buy advertising, and a Facebook ad template tool makes it easy to create high-quality ads in minutes. After choosing a template you like, you can customize it with images, color, and text to your liking. Once complete, simply download it to use. 5. Be Mindful of Your Mental Health When you start to feel anxious, reach out to a mental health expert. You can access services online through a more convenient process. Plus, you typically have more affordable options with access to more specialists. You'll save time on traveling, and you can even shop for the right therapist by searching for those that offer a complimentary consultation. Don't underestimate the benefits of the occasional retail therapy either.  6. Find a Day Job With Flexibility If you're currently nurturing a side hustle, find a day job that offers more flexibility, such as working remotely or a shorter work week. Beef up your resume by updating it with new skills and experiences. It's best to send your resume as a PDF. Therefore, access an online conversion tool that allows you to convert to a Word document for editing and back to a PDF to send it out. All you need to do is upload the PDF, convert it to Word, and start making edits. Then save it as a PDF and send it. If you're new to the side hustle world, you'll find it overwhelming at times. The best way to push through when it becomes too much is to give yourself a break. The tips above are all about finding that downtown and using it to take care of yourself.Image via Pexels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

However, lack of sleep could be the one thing stopping you from reaching your goals. Research shows that getting enough sleep can improve your memory and help with creativity. Start by organizing your schedule and adhering to it as rigidly as possible. Remind yourself to stay on track because the meeting with your bed is just as imp",

Designate an area in your home with no distractions. It could be a corner in the spare bedroom or a space on the back porch. Go there every morning before you start your day and take at least five minutes of meditation to start. You can build on that over time. 3. Exercise and Eat Well Taking care of your physical",

Be mindful of what you eat as well. For example, processed foods can make you feel sluggish and cause anxiety. Stick to nutrient-dense options, such as fruits, vegetables, and lean meats. 4.

Find a Day Job With Flexibility If you're currently nurturing a side hustle, find a day job that offers more flexibility, such as working remotely or a shorter work week. Beef up your resume by updating it with new skills and experiences. It's best to send your resume as a PDF. Therefore, access an online conversion tool that allows you to convert to a Word document for edit",

When handled responsibly, it can be a way to relax in social situations, celebrate with loved ones, and even decompress after a long day at work. When it’s abused, though, it can be dangerous — drinking can change the way you think and see the world, and it’s not always for the better.People abuse alcohol for all kinds of reasons — financial woes, relationship problems, and trouble at work all tend to be big contributors — and in many different ways. Abuse isn’t always synonymous with alcoholism; even on the weekends is considered abuse. But drinking isn’t the best way to cope with problems, and can even make them appear so massive that ending it all seems like the only way out. In fact, alcohol is a factor in over a quarter of all suicides in the United States and more than a third of suicide victims used alcohol just prior to death.Coping with an alcohol abuse problem and the suicidal tendencies that sometimes accompany it is a slippery slope to say the least. This guide will help to lead the way to cleaner, happier living by outlining the relationship between alcohol abuse and suicidal thoughts and how to overcome both.

To this end, a major wheelchair user housing study was carried out by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive in 2006Wheelchair users who participated in the study revealed that, besides general locomotion, areas of common concern or particular difficulties frequently experienced in people’s own homes included:personal care, such as getting in and out of bed, washing or dressingfood preparation and eatingreaching up or down to access cupboards, shelves, washing lines etcdifficulties relating to loss of sensation(s)handling and manipulating items such as knobs, levers, standalone objects or heavy/bulky equipment It’s important to consider and address all these sorts of challenges - and most importantly, to listen to the experiences of the wheelchair user - when putting together any detailed checklist for improved home safety.For the rest of this very through and helpful article, please visit https://uk.rs-online.com/web/generalDisplay.html?id=/home-safety-checklist-wheelchair-users​ Thank you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Working as a counselor takes a certain type of person who possesses ideal traits and has developed a good understanding of themselves which can then be applied to others. Unfortunately, years of studying can’t always offer this, so determining if you would suit the role of a counselor before becoming invested in it is essential. Effective and adaptive communication is key It seems obvious, but the biggest thing a counselor needs to be good at is communication. Communication can be learnt to a certain extent but some traits and innate skills go a long way. You need to be able to understand how what you’re saying to someone will be accepted and interpreted, including people who have faulty think patterns.You also need to be able to quickly pick up on how the person will best respond to you. For instance, some people appreciate direct and blunt communication that doesn’t beat around the bush, while others can be offended by this and instead need positive reinforcement that gives them time to accept what you’re saying. Being a good communicator will help people to feel confident in you and your skills as a counselor.Listen to the past but focus on the future A person’s past shapes how they are in the present, so listening to these stories is a crucial first step for counseling, but essentially why a person is seeing a counselor is because they want to change where their future is heading. This can be needing healthy coping mechanisms, changing faulty thinking patterns, or overcoming addiction. Someone with an INFJ personality type, also known as a \"confidant,\" is particularly good at focusing on the future, making them ideal personality types for counseling. They also score as the most empathetic personality of all the Myer-Briggs types, adding to their ideal traits. Being able to hear other’s storiesCounselors need to master being sensitive to other’s feelings, problems, and needs, which can involve hearing horrific stories, often of abuse, whilst also being able to see how the person can be helped. Being able to process what has happened to someone and how it is affecting them in the present can be difficult, especially when you’re still getting to know a person, but is an essential part of being a counselor. Additionally, some people struggle to hear sad stories and can be affected by them for hours, if not days. While having empathy is important, having too much can make you some people too sensitive to be able to mentally cope with being a counselor.​Studying and training is an essential part of being a counselor, but some people have innate personality traits and skills that make them a perfect fit for the role. It’s important to investigate whether your personality suits being a counselor before investing your time and money into a career choice that may not be for you in the end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

As a counseling professional, taking such statistics into consideration can allow you to help others by recommending the idea of pet ownership to those who are experiencing mental health challenges. From stress relief to inspiring mindfulness and simply boosting your mood, there are a number of ways that pets can help.The benefits involvedOwning a pet, such as a dog, can have many surprising mental health benefits — for example, in addition to inspiring mindfulness, dogs are well known for relieving stress, and many colleges and workplaces have taken note by creating dog-friendly environments for students and employees. In fact, when the University of British Columbia brought in therapy dogs for students, they reported that they were not only less stressed, but were happier and had higher levels of energy afterwards when surveyed. Additionally, dogs are also known to require regular exercise — such as daily walks — that can help you to stay active, which has mental health benefits of its own. Even fish can prove to be beneficial to our mental health. For instance, because of how calming they can be to watch, having a pet fish can be a relaxing experience that can help reduce anxiety. Research by Plymouth University found that simply watching fish (in an aquarium) led to reductions in blood pressure and heart rate. Because of their calming ability, fish tanks are often seen in waiting rooms at doctors’ offices, nursing homes, and more. Setting up your home aquarium can also be beneficial to your mental health in some unexpectedly unique ways, too. Setting up an aquarium and remembering why sustainability matters when building a fish tank can deepen your connection with nature, which has a myriad of benefits on its own. Getting startedWhen it comes to getting started when looking to own a pet and reap the mental health benefits, spending time with your pet is a wonderful way to start. Taking your dog out for regular walks, brushing your cat, and actually taking some time to enjoy watching your home aquarium are all great ways to spend time with your pets. If you don’t yet own a pet, you can easily adopt one via your local pound, humane society, or pet store.However, it’s important to take your time when deciding on the perfect pet, as it’s necessary to choose one that fits your needs and lifestyle. For instance, a dog can make a great pet for those who want to stay active, while fish are ideal for those who may be allergic to dogs or don’t have the time to go on regular walks each day. No matter which pet you choose, your mental health is sure to receive a boost whenever you’re around them.​Pets make great companions and are oftentimes regarded as a member of the family, though there are a number of mental health benefits that come along with pet ownership to be aware of. From fish to dogs, having a pet can help with many things, including reducing anxiety, promoting an active lifestyle, and relieving stress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

However, the client – like all of us - needs favorable conditions in  which to blossom and bloom.*****“Founder”: Carl Rogers (1902 – 1987)If  I can provide a certain type of relationship, the other person will  discover within himself [sic] the capacity to use that relationship for  growth and change, and personal development will occur. – Carl Rogers*****A  good image of Rogerian counseling is of a plant – the counselor  provides the growth-promoting climate and the client is then free and  able to discover and grow as she / he wants and needs to.  In a successful Client Centered session, the following characteristics will prevail: •\tEmpathy•\tAcceptance or Unconditional Positive Regard•\tGenuineness EmpathyThe  counselor accurately understands the client's thoughts and feelings  from the client's own perspective. When the counselor is willing and  able to experience the world from the client's point of view, it shows  the client that her/his perspective has value and she/he is accepted. Acceptance or Unconditional Positive RegardThe  counselor accepts the client without conditions, without judgment. This  frees the client to explore her/his thoughts and feelings, positive or  negative, without danger of rejection or condemnation. GenuinenessThe  counselor is authentic and does not put on a professional “I know best”  façade. The counselor is “there” for the client and is “real”. In this  way the client does not have to worry about what the counselor is really  like or truly thinks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechniques \n\n Client Centered counselors would not say they use techniques – rather  they have an approach of being empathetic, accepting and truly “there”  for the client. Having said that the following skills are central:•\tActive and empathic listening•\tReflection of content and feelings•\tGenuineness which may include appropriate self-disclosure by counselor  Do the first two sound familiar? They should! We covered these when we  learned basic counseling skills. If you have not already studied and  practiced these or if you would like to review, click on these buttons  on the LHS of your screen:• Active Listening • Encouraging Body Language • Good Tone • Open Ended and Closed Questions • Paraphrasing • Summarizing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Disclosure\nSelf-Disclosure falls under the notion of genuineness in Client  Centered counseling, and can be a bit of a tricky area. Too much  self-revelation and the client may lose respect for you; not enough and  the client may think you are not a fellow human.In our Sample Session One,  we meet a counselor named Joan. In terms of her office environment, we  might think it is a little too “genuine.” The client, Mary, could think  Joan was loopy. And the “goodie bag”? That’s taking a risk. At the same  time, Joan does not reveal anything about her personal life through her  words. Precious talk time needs to be used by Mary and it is.In Sample Session Four,  Joan uses self-disclosure. When Mary expresses guilt about not talking  to her mother enough, Joan assures her by saying, “Mary I want you to  know that you aren’t alone in your struggles with your parents. I’m a  daughter too and don’t call home as much as I think I should; and my  daughter feels that way about me. OK, so this is a common challenge.”This  empathic, non-judgmental comment shows that Joan is very real – but in  no way is Joan dominating the session or attempting to bend it to  herself. She remains client centered.Some good general guidelines about self disclosure:1. \tFirst impressions are lasting impressions. What you wear and what your  office looks like speak volumes about you. Try to find a balance. If you  are eccentric, tone it down; if you are a minimalist, soften things  with a plant and a picture.2.\tGenerally speaking, in the first  session it is best not to reveal personal information about yourself.  You don’t want the client to dislike you because of a non-essential  disclosure. 3.\tLess is best. The session is about the client. She  or he is not there to hear about you and your challenges, or to discuss  the things you’d like to talk about.4.\tIf you do share an incident in your own life, make sure it’s one that had a positive resolution. \n\n\n\nFurther Reading and VideosBooks\n“On Becoming A Person” by Carl Rogers, Houghton Mifflin Books, 1995\"Kitchen Table Wisdom\" by Rachel Naomi Remen, Rivertrade, 2006Therapy ResourcePACT Therapy - https://www.choosingtherapy.com/pact-therapy/ - a reader's contributionVideoHere is a sample of a Person Centered counseling session.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ew8CAr1v48M&feature=related \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most basic and powerful way to connect to another person is to listen.Just listen.Perhaps  the most important thing we ever give each other is our attention...A  loving silence often has far more power to heal and to connect than the  most well-intentioned words. - Rachel Naomi Remen \n\n\n\n\nBuy  at AllPosters.com\n\n\n\n\ntake me to the top of the page!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In terms of her office environment, we  might think it is a little too “genuine.” The client, Mary, could think  Joan was loopy. And the “goodie bag”? That’s taking a risk. At the same  time, Joan does not reveal anything about her personal life through her  words. Precious talk time needs to be used by Mary and it is.In Sample Sessio",

I’m a  daughter too and don’t call home as much as I think I should; and my  daughter feels that way about me.

If you  are eccentric, tone it down; if you are a minimalist, soften things  with a plant and a picture.2.\tGenerally speaking, in the first  session it is best not to reveal personal information about yourself.

Mary never returned to counseling for a ninth session. Joan   hadn’t suggested to Mary that maybe Mary was “good to go” because Joan   really liked her sessions with Mary. Difficulty with \"becoming   unnecessary\" happens. That’s why many organizations have a maximum   number of sessions – it’s as much for the counselor as it is for the   client. See Richard Nelson-Jones'  \"Introduction to Counseling Skills\"  for an excellent chapter on \"Terminating Counseling and Helping.\"   At the same time, most clients fall away after their second or third   session. People, for the most part, know what they want and need. If   they feel their need has been met and they really don’t want to do the   counseling thing anymore, that’s a good choice.Joan reviews  her charts  monthly and if a client has disappeared for more than four  weeks she  sends a follow up email. She wrote, “Hi Mary! Hope all is well  with  you. Best! / joan” A few weeks later Joan received this email. “Thanks  for the email. Was  too busy at the time to write back. It’s all good.  Andy and I are still  getting all the stuff done we need to go teaching  in Korea. Good thing  both of us want to do this – keeps us motivated!  Lots of paper work!I   passed my courses – including Contemporary Asian History.  In fact I   did really well. It’s funny how when you get interested in something,   you do better!  Let you know how things go!  - Mary.” And that was the last Joan heard of Mary for three years. This is what \"becoming unnecessary\" is all about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime Passes\nThree years later Joan picked up the College’s Alumni magazine and  saw a picture of Mary with Andy. A wedding picture! They had started up a  Canada-Korea Café which served a variety of foods including Korean.  Each table was said to feature a Korean floral arrangement. That had to  be Mary.Mary had taken a “Teaching English as a Second Language”  course after her first trip to Korea and they returned for a second  year. Now she was finishing Teachers College in Buffalo, New York.  Right, that would only be about a 30 minute drive!Not only that,  they had a baby boy named ‘Young-Jae’. Jay was the name of Mary’s dad  who had since passed away. And look at that, another picture. Mary’s mom  holding her grandson with a smile that would outshine the sun! And they  have a girl child in North Korea they are sponsoring through a  humanitarian organization.Oh and there is now a \"guerilla  gardening\" group in their town. Joan's pretty sure she knows who started  that up! And they donate any leftovers to the area soup kitchen. How  awesome is that!  Joan is thrilled for them. She really believes in the benefit of  counseling – especially the whole health and existential sessions.  Still, she wishes Mary had kept in touch and that Joan's help had  somehow been acknowledged. Selfish, she knows. But there you have it –  counselors are human too and becoming unnecessary can be painful! At the  same time Joan knows...\nA teacher [and counselor] is one who makes him [or her] self progressively unnecessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntake me to the top of this page!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\nPhoto from andrewmalone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

That’s why many organizations have a maximum   number of sessions – it’s as much for the counselor as it is for the   client. See Richard Nelson-Jones'  \"Introduction to Counseling Skills\"  for an excellent chapter on \"Terminating Counseling and Helping.\"   At the same time, most clients fall away after their second or third   session.

            "and they really don’t want to do the   counseling thing anymore, that’s a good choice.Joan reviews  her charts  monthly and if a client has disappeared for more than four  weeks she  sends a follow up email. She wrote, “Hi Mary! Hope all is well  with  you. Best! / joan” A few weeks later Joan received this email. “Thanks  for the email. Was  too busy at the time to write back. It’s all good.

For Session Four, Mary arrives early. Joan could see her early since her  last client had to leave a little early – but Joan knows if she does  this, the message being sent by the counselor is “whenever you get here –  that’s fine.” Joan uses these fifteen extra minutes for follow-up calls  on other concerns. Then she takes the few minutes needed to make  herself comfortable and reads her notes from the last session to make  sure she’s on task. \nIntroduction - The First Ten Minutes \n\n Joan walks with Mary into her office, offers her a chair and the  usual array of beverages and snacks. Mary smiles and instead gives Joan a  coffee and a muffin – and Mary has this too. In her social work  training she was warned against taking gifts from clients – this can  make them think you are “in their pocket.”At the same time, Joan  recognizes an apology when she sees it (and eats and drinks it!) and  says, “Thank you very much.” Even though Joan is not a coffee drinker,  she makes a point of having a sip and telling Mary that it’s very good,  and although Joan is wheat-intolerant, she tells Mary she’ll enjoy the  muffin at break. She also in a friendly way indicates that next time the  treat is on her and points to her array of water, milk, apples and  granola bars.Joan explains how this session will look.1.\tThey will discuss how the past week(s) have gone with respect to Mary’s concerns.2.\tThey will review what happened at the past session.3.\tThey will work on the issue Mary is most concerned about.4.\tThere will be homework… :-) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation Gathering - The Next 20 Minutes (or a little less)\nJoan asks, “So how have things been going?\"  She could have made  reference to the crying, boyfriend, school, and folks if Mary had been a  person inclined to \"yak\". In such a situation,, Joan would need to  provide a framework so that time isn’t used discussing the news, the  latest movie, etc. Mary is inclined to be very direct, so framing isn't a  concern. Mary starts, “Believe it or not, the crying has  actually gotten better. Once I picked up that prescription – it was like  I had really said to myself – ‘I am so done with this!’ Now I know it’s  not the drugs, they would take a few weeks to kick it. But I  reviewed my ‘crying chart’ – I only filled it in for a few days, but I  could see a pattern. I would sleep in and feel like crap because I’d  slept in so I’d have a cry over that. I’d have missed a class so I’d be  ticked about that. I’d be ok in the afternoon – going to class, being  with friends. And making supper with Andy was ok, as long as we didn’t  talk about my problems. After supper tho, I’d just lump out on  the couch watching TV. I felt so alone. Andy would go to bed early  because he had to get up for work – and then I’d cry and cry and cry.”Joan wants to keep Mary talking – this is information gathering time. “So you’re seeing a pattern here?”Mary:  “Yes. The sleeping in is not worth it. I don’t feel more rested, I see  less of Andy, I miss class, and then I stay up way too late.” Joan  senses that this is all Mary wants to report about the crying but she  still wants Mary to talk and talk and talk. “How about your relationship  with Andy?”Mary: “It reached an all time low about a week after  our last appointment. He said, ‘I love you Mary, but I can’t stand this.  I feel I cannot make you happy – no matter what I do.’ And that really  scared me. I realized that all I did was bitch at him. So I’m  really trying to save my unloading for here and with my friend Sarah.  She’s been through something like this before and I listened to her. Now  it’s her turn to listen to me.”Note: Mary is demonstrating  strengths based counseling techniques already. Some of her strengths are  acuity, determination, and a supportive partner and friend.Joan  feels a little desperate. Mary seems to have everything all sorted out –  why does she even need to be here? Oops! It’s not about Joan – it’s  about Mary. “Mary, how is it going with the schooling?”Mary:  \"Better since I’ve started going to my morning classes. And I really  appreciate those info sheets in the goody bag. I didn’t know we had peer  tutoring here, and that library tour? Amazing! I have such a phobia  about libraries.\"Joan: \"And that one course, Contemporary Asian History?\"Mary: \"I’m still not doing great – I just can’t do all the reading. That’s the one I’m getting the peer tutor for.\"Joan  at this point could dig a little deeper into the course – but Mary  appears not to be too worried about it. “How goes it with your folks?”Mary: “Awful, just awful. I am such a huge disappointment to them. I wish I had a sibling they could pick on.”Joan: “Of the challenges you’ve stated so far, would you say this is the one you’d like to address today?”Mary: “Most definitely.”Joan: “So tell me more about your folks and your relationship with them?”Mary:  “Well, as you know, I am their only child and a girl. They wanted a boy  – no luck. Then they wanted me to be a doctor – but I don’t have a head  for math and science. So I decided to try nursing – but it’s math and  science heavy too. Plus, I can’t stand the site of blood and the smell  of infection and puke and sh*t?! Well you get my point.”Joan smiles and nods, giving Mary permission to continue. We'll get the to Strengths Based Counseling part of this shortly.Mary:  “It turns out, I really like history. Love it. Or at least I thought I  did. But my marks aren’t good enough to do a four year degree, so I’m  doing a three year. So I’m not even going to be able to get into  teacher’s college. So here I am, almost four year later, $40,000 in debt  and no way to pay it back! I’m so screwed!”Joan: “So it sounds  like what’s bothering you is that your parents have expectations of you  that you can meet AND you feel you are hopelessly in debt.”Mary:  “Yeah. And when I think about that I really get upset (eyes are  watering), I think Andy will dump me because I’m such a burden. It feels  pointless to go to class. I know this sounds dumb, but at least as long  as I’m in school, I don’t have to pay back my OSAP.”Joan: “You aren’t the first person to feel that way…”  Note: Joan has made a note to follow up on addressing Mary's debt  concerns. Mary cannot change how her parents feel about her - at least  not directly. But she can address her debt problem, and it's a huge  problem for her.Mary: “And my parents have no idea how hard  it is to be me. Dad got a job right out of high school; Mom had me  within a year of getting married. Then she had to have a hysterectomy –  for some reason. And tra-da. This is what they end up with.”Joan would love to move to discussion right now but really wants Mary to explore her feelings about her parents more.Joan: “You feel you’ve disappointed them.”Mary: “Yes. I just plain hate myself.” (Mary is now tearing. That’s OK. Joan makes sure she has access to tissues and water.)Hmm,  Joan does not like where this is going. It’s one thing to have a person  express their feelings, but if they are all negative, the person is  simply reinforcing their own self-hatred. One of the things Joan learned  in school is the strengths-based or positive thinking / learned optimisim approach” – you can only build on strengths and you can learn to project positively. Delving  deeply into parent-child relationships has its place in certain kinds  of therapy, but Joan does not have specialized training in  psychoanalysis. And Joan sees no reason to refer Mary to a psychologist  or psychiatrist. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion - The Next Ten Minutes (plus a little more) \nJoan: “Mary, is there anything you like about yourself?”Mary: “That’s a stupid question. Of course there is.”Joan: “Name one.”Mary: “I don’t see what this has to do with my parents.”Joan: “Trust me on this one. Name one thing.”Mary is getting ticked, but she’s not being abusive. And Joan remembers that inside, Mary is still feeling pretty badly.Mary: “I like that I’m not afraid to tell people when they are being stupid.”Joan could choose to react negatively to that comment or turn it around. She chooses the latter.Joan: “OK, so you feel comfortable being direct with people, not afraid of confrontation.”Mary: “Yeah.”Joan: “Anything else.”Mary: “I like my hair. It’s thick and takes dye well. Or is that too ridiculous for your list?!”Joan: “Not at all. What we’re doing here is an exercise called The Ten Things I Like About Me. This little task comes out of something called The Strengths Based Counseling approach and the idea is that you can only build from strengths, not weaknesses.Anyhoo  – you don’t have to stop at ten things you like about yourself. And the  'things' can be anything – you hair, your personality, your hobbies,  your quirks.“For example, I’m an avid gardener – with an interest  in sunflowers.  Every summer I plant about ten different kinds of  sunflowers. Six out of 10 usually make it – but it’s a pass!” Joan is taking a big of a risk here in disclosing personal information - but as long as it's not directing attention toward herself and is helping the flow of Mary's thoughts, that's OK.Mary: “I have a green enough thumb, but you know what's really cool? ... I can life one eyebrow at a time.”Joan: “Good, keep going.”Mary:  “This is going to sound stuck-up, but I’m a great singer. Really good.  My parents bought me voice and piano lessons, plus I sang at high school  in musicals. And I was – and this is embarrassing – part of a group  called Tormenting Teens.”Joan: (Grins and isn't surprised about the tormenting part.) “Great singer! And singing is a good stress reliever too.”Mary: “You’re telling me! Man, you are a goodie two-shoes. Um…………. That’s about it. How many am I up to?”Joan looks at her brief notes: 1.\tComfortable being direct with people2.\tAmazing hair – thick, easily colored3.\tCan life one eyebrow at a time4.\tGreat singer“You’re at four already. Keep going.”Mary: “That’s it.”Joan:  “If I was to ask your friend Sarah what some of your positive qualities  are, what you can like about yourself – what might she say?”Mary: Sighs. \"I thought this was about me… OK, I’m very loyal. When she was down, I was there.\"Joan: “5. Very loyal to friends.”Mary: “I’m lots of fun at parties. Put the karaoke machine on and I’m there.”Joan writes down, “6. Lots of fun to be around – especially at parties.” (Mary has run out of steam again.) Joan: “What might Andy say?”Mary: “You won’t to hear that part!” (Raises eyebrow!)Joan: “How about 7. Very loving partner?”Mary: “Sure, cuz I do love him and would never cheat on him.”Joan: “Very loving, faithful partner! :-)”Mary: “I’m a wicked Frisbee player. In fact, I’m in a league.”Joan: “8. Competitive Frisbee player. What might your teachers say?”Mary: “That’s positive? Not much. Hmm. I can pull an all nighter and still get a B!”Joan: ”9. A quick-on-the-uptake student!?”Mary: “Aren’t you going to lecture me about the importance of marks?”Joan: “Mary, you know that already. Here’s a good one. What might your parents say that’s nice about you?”Mary: (Snorts.) \"That I live far away?!”Joan: “Nope.”Mary: “That I never call them?”Joan: “Times running out… (Grins.)”Mary: “I don’t hang up on them when they call.”Joan: “10. Willing to listen to her parents.”Mary: “I don’t want to - but mom is lonely.”Joan: “10. Listens to her parents?\"Mary: “I’ll accept that.”Joan:  \"Mary I want you to know that you aren’t alone in your struggles with  your parents. I’m a daughter too and don’t call home as much as I think I  should; and my daughter feels that way about me. OK, so this is a  common challenge.”More self-disclosure from Joan. It would  not be a good thing in the initial session, but by now Joan has  established credibility in the eyes of Mary.Mary: \"Thank you for saying that. I was beginning to wonder if you were a robot!\"Joan: “May I add one?”(said in a robotic toying tone.)Mary: “Sure but don’t knock yourself out.”Joan: “You are feisty as anything. Resilience is one of the best traits any of us can have.”Mary: “You’re sounding like a counselor.”Joan: “Guess what. I am a counselor – AND I can point to lots of evidence that you are hardy.”Mary: “Just not a Hardy BOY!” (Laughs.)Joan:  “You’re too young to know about them. (Laughs too.) OK, we have to  start wrapping up right about now. So I’d like to give a recap of what  we did today and you feel free to tell me if I’m getting this wrong…”  Joan has written two or three word notes along the way. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion: Ten Minutes\n Joan: “You took a break from counseling because you didn’t think it  would work – but your doctor and pharmacist encouraged you to give it a  try.”Mary: “That’s party right – but I made the decision when I experienced that one moment of feeling good.”Joan:  “You did a little mood mapping and found that what seemed to be behind  the crying was the oversleeping, skipping class, Andy not wanting to  hear you talk about your problems, and being alone at night.”Mary: “You missed the part about my folks.”Joan:  “I’m getting there. Things are getting better with Andy because you are  going to bed and getting up at the same time AND you’re not unloading  on him all the time.”Mary: “Yeah. Actually, we actually have made  a point of starting to talk about things that are going well. And  playing Frisbee instead of watching TV.”Joan: ”Fab! Things are  going better in school because you are attending class. I expect you are  doing the readings more too, huh?”Mary: “Yeah…”Joan: “But  you feel you cannot measure up to your parents expectations. They  wanted a boy, a big family, a doctor or at least a nurse. And what  they’ve got is a gal, an only child who is doing a 3 year degree in  History.”Mary: “You sure know how to hurt a gal.”Joan:  “Actually, you’re the one who said it. I’m simply making sure I’ve got  what you are conveying – correctly. Or close enough.”Mary: “Close enough.”Joan:  “BUT you are more than a daughter. You are a whole human being with  many assets and we listed eleven of them. We could have gone on but time  doesn’t permit. (Mary rolls her eyes and starts to tune out. Joan is  getting way too preachy.) I’m going to type these up for you and include  a picture of something that makes you feel good. What would that be?”Mary: “Tim Horton’s coffee!”Joan:  “OK, a Timmy's. I’m going to print it off and plasticize it and give  you two copies and keep one for your file. And I’m going to ask you to  keep one in your backpack and put one on your fridge or your mirror or  somewhere where you will be reminded of your good points – everyday.”Mary: “Sounds pretty Pollyanna-ish to me! So what’s my homework this week teacher?!”Joan:  “I’m a big fan of charting. Would you like to do another week sheet and  this time chart positive things that happened within those time frames -  8 am to noon, noon to 3, 3 to 6, 6 to bedtime.”Mary: “I could say ‘yes’ and you’d feel good, but I know I won’t. Any other ideas?”Joan: “Journaling – with an eye to the positives?”Mary: “That I could do. By the way, I really like my flower pen!” As always Joan ended the session by asking about the things her  client had to look forward to over the next few days. And there were  some. Joan asked about appointment bookings. Mary had only booked  four and had used two and missed two. Mary said she would do that on  her way out of student services. Today, Mary didn’t try to hug Joan. Instead, Mary offered Joan a firm handshake. Mary was feeling more in control!end of Session Four - Strengths Based Counseling Session \n\n\n\n\n\nFor myself I am an optimist - it does not seem to be much use being anything else. - Winston Churchill\n\n\n\n\nBuy  at AllPosters.com\n\n\n\n\ntake me to the top of this page!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

For Session Four, Mary arrives early. Joan could see her early since",
            " her  last client had to leave a little early – but Joan knows if she does  this, the message being sent by the counselor is “whenever you get here –  that’s fine.” Joan uses these fifteen extra minutes for follow-up calls  on other concerns. Then she takes the few minutes needed to make  herself comfortable and reads her notes from the last session to make  sure she’s on task. \nIntroduction - The First Ten Minutes \n\n Joan walks with Mary into her office, offers her a chair and the  usual array ",
            "of beverages and snacks. Mary smiles and instead gives Joan a  coffee and a muffin – and Mary has this too. In her social work  training she was warned against taking gifts from clients – this can  make them think you are “in their pocket.”At the same time, Joan  recognizes an apology when she sees it (and eats and drinks it!) and  says, “Thank you very much.” Even though Joan is not a coffee drinker,  she makes a point of having a sip and telling Mary that it’s very good,  and although Joan is ",
            "wheat-intolerant, she tells Mary she’ll enjoy the  muffin at break. She also in a friendly way indicates that next time the  treat is on her and points to her array of water, milk, apples and  granola bars.Joan explains how this session will look.1.\tThey will discuss how the past week(s) have gone with respect to Mary’s concerns.2.\tThey will review what happened at the past session.3.\tThey will work on the issue Mary is most concerned about.4.\tThere will be homework… :-) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation Ga",
            "thering - The Next 20 Minutes (or a little less)\nJoan asks, “So how have things been going?\"  She could have made  reference to the crying, boyfriend, school, and folks if Mary had been a  person inclined to \"yak\". In such a situation,, Joan would need to  provide a framework so that time isn’t used discussing the news, the  latest movie, etc. Mary is inclined to be very direct, so framing isn't a  concern. Mary starts, “Believe it or not, the crying has  actually gotten better. Once I picked up",
            " that prescription – it was like  I had really said to myself – ‘I am so done with this!’ Now I know it’s  not the drugs, they would take a few weeks to kick it. But I  reviewed my ‘crying chart’ – I only filled it in for a few days, but I  could see a pattern. I would sleep in and feel like crap because I’d  slept in so I’d have a cry over that. I’d have missed a class so I’d be  ticked about that. I’d be ok in the afternoon – going to class, being  with friends. And making supper with Andy was",
            " ok, as long as we didn’t  talk about my problems. After supper tho, I’d just lump out on  the couch watching TV. I felt so alone. Andy would go to bed early  because he had to get up for work – and then I’d cry and cry and cry.”Joan wants to keep Mary talking – this is information gathering time. “So you’re seeing a pattern here?”Mary:  “Yes. The sleeping in is not worth it. I don’t feel more rested, I see  less of Andy, I miss class, and then I stay up way too late.” Joan  senses that this is ",
            "all Mary wants to report about the crying but she  still wants Mary to talk and talk and talk. “How about your relationship  with Andy?”Mary: “It reached an all time low about a week after  our last appointment. He said, ‘I love you Mary, but I can’t stand this.  I feel I cannot make you happy – no matter what I do.’ And that really  scared me. I realized that all I did was bitch at him. So I’m  really trying to save my unloading for here and with my friend Sarah.  She’s been through something l",
            "ike this before and I listened to her. Now  it’s her turn to listen to me.”Note: Mary is demonstrating  strengths based counseling techniques already. Some of her strengths are  acuity, determination, and a supportive partner and friend.Joan  feels a little desperate. Mary seems to have everything all sorted out –  why does she even need to be here? Oops! It’s not about Joan – it’s  about Mary. “Mary, how is it going with the schooling?”Mary:  \"Better since I’ve started going to my morning class",
            "es. And I really  appreciate those info sheets in the goody bag. I didn’t know we had peer  tutoring here, and that library tour? Amazing! I have such a phobia  about libraries.\"Joan: \"And that one course, Contemporary Asian History?\"Mary: \"I’m still not doing great – I just can’t do all the reading. That’s the one I’m getting the peer tutor for.\"Joan  at this point could dig a little deeper into the course – but Mary  appears not to be too worried about it. “How goes it with your folks?”Mary: “",
            "Awful, just awful. I am such a huge disappointment to them. I wish I had a sibling they could pick on.”Joan: “Of the challenges you’ve stated so far, would you say this is the one you’d like to address today?”Mary: “Most definitely.”Joan: “So tell me more about your folks and your relationship with them?”Mary:  “Well, as you know, I am their only child and a girl. They wanted a boy  – no luck. Then they wanted me to be a doctor – but I don’t have a head  for math and science. So I decided to try",
            " nursing – but it’s math and  science heavy too. Plus, I can’t stand the site of blood and the smell  of infection and puke and sh*t?! Well you get my point.”Joan smiles and nods, giving Mary permission to continue. We'll get the to Strengths Based Counseling part of this shortly.Mary:  “It turns out, I really like history. Love it. Or at least I thought I  did. But my marks aren’t good enough to do a four year degree, so I’m  doing a three year. So I’m not even going to be able to get into  tea",
            "cher’s college. So here I am, almost four year later, $40,000 in debt  and no way to pay it back! I’m so screwed!”Joan: “So it sounds  like what’s bothering you is that your parents have expectations of you  that you can meet AND you feel you are hopelessly in debt.”Mary:  “Yeah. And when I think about that I really get upset (eyes are  watering), I think Andy will dump me because I’m such a burden. It feels  pointless to go to class. I know this sounds dumb, but at least as long  as I’m in scho",
            "ol, I don’t have to pay back my OSAP.”Joan: “You aren’t the first person to feel that way…”  Note: Joan has made a note to follow up on addressing Mary's debt  concerns. Mary cannot change how her parents feel about her - at least  not directly. But she can address her debt problem, and it's a huge  problem for her.Mary: “And my parents have no idea how hard  it is to be me. Dad got a job right out of high school; Mom had me  within a year of getting married. Then she had to have a hysterectomy ",
            "–  for some reason. And tra-da. This is what they end up with.”Joan would love to move to discussion right now but really wants Mary to explore her feelings about her parents more.Joan: “You feel you’ve disappointed them.”Mary: “Yes. I just plain hate myself.” (Mary is now tearing. That’s OK. Joan makes sure she has access to tissues and water.)Hmm,  Joan does not like where this is going. It’s one thing to have a person  express their feelings, but if they are all negative, the person is  simpl",
            "y reinforcing their own self-hatred. One of the things Joan learned  in school is the strengths-based or positive thinking / learned optimisim approach” – you can only build on strengths and you can learn to project positively. Delving  deeply into parent-child relationships has its place in certain kinds  of therapy, but Joan does not have specialized training in  psychoanalysis. And Joan sees no reason to refer Mary to a psychologist  or psychiatrist. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion - The Next Ten Minutes",
            " (plus a little more) \nJoan: “Mary, is there anything you like about yourself?”Mary: “That’s a stupid question. Of course there is.”Joan: “Name one.”Mary: “I don’t see what this has to do with my parents.”Joan: “Trust me on this one. Name one thing.”Mary is getting ticked, but she’s not being abusive. And Joan remembers that inside, Mary is still feeling pretty badly.Mary: “I like that I’m not afraid to tell people when they are being stupid.”Joan could choose to react negatively to that comment",
            " or turn it around. She chooses the latter.Joan: “OK, so you feel comfortable being direct with people, not afraid of confrontation.”Mary: “Yeah.”Joan: “Anything else.”Mary: “I like my hair. It’s thick and takes dye well. Or is that too ridiculous for your list?!”Joan: “Not at all. What we’re doing here is an exercise called The Ten Things I Like About Me. This little task comes out of something called The Strengths Based Counseling approach and the idea is that you can only build from strengths",
            ", not weaknesses.Anyhoo  – you don’t have to stop at ten things you like about yourself. And the  'things' can be anything – you hair, your personality, your hobbies,  your quirks.“For example, I’m an avid gardener – with an interest  in sunflowers.  Every summer I plant about ten different kinds of  sunflowers. Six out of 10 usually make it – but it’s a pass!” Joan is taking a big of a risk here in disclosing personal information - but as long as it's not directing attention toward herself and ",
            "is helping the flow of Mary's thoughts, that's OK.Mary: “I have a green enough thumb, but you know what's really cool? ... I can life one eyebrow at a time.”Joan: “Good, keep going.”Mary:  “This is going to sound stuck-up, but I’m a great singer. Really good.  My parents bought me voice and piano lessons, plus I sang at high school  in musicals.

Put the karaoke machine on and I’m there.”Joan writes down, “6. Lots of fun to be around – especially at parties.” (Mary has run out of steam again.) Joan: “What might Andy say?”Mary: “You won’t to hear that part!” (Raises eyebrow!)Joan: “How about 7. Very loving partner?”Mary: “Sure, cuz I do love him and would never cheat on him",

A quick-on-the-uptake student!?”Mary: “Aren’t you going to lecture me about the importance of marks?”Joan: “Mary, you know that already. Here’s a good one.

It would  not be a good thing in the initial session, but by now Joan has  established credibility in the eyes of Mary.Mary: \"Thank you for saying that. I was beginning to wonder if you were a robot!\"Joan: “May I add one?”(said in a robotic toying tone.)Mary: “Sure but don’t knock yourself out.”Joan: “You are feisty as anything.

OK, we have to  start wrapping up right about now. So I’d like to give a recap of what  we did today and you feel free to tell me if I’m getting this wrong…”  Joan has written two or three word notes along the way. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion: Ten Minutes\n Joan: “You took a break from counseling because you didn’t think it  w",

However, counselors can greatly help individuals with their psychological needs, especially in going through the five stages of financial debt.DenialThe first reaction to dealing with a problem is to deny that it is happening because it is the common defense mechanism to buffer the weight of the problem.  In case of financial issues, you deny the situation by underestimating how much you owe or you don’t open your bills and just leave them in a drawer. Aside from denying the situation, some people would also feel fear and anxiety.  According to Anxiety and Depression Association of America, around 40 million Americans suffer from anxiety disorders, and being worried about debts is one of the triggers of such disorders. Even recent college graduates need to keep their finances on track because of their student loan debts.  A counselor can help you know certain techniques to manage your anxiety so that it won’t add to your financial problems.AngerIndividuals in debt are very stressed on so many levels and the only way they could cope with the situation is to get angry.  They get mad at their creditors who send them the bills, mad at their bosses for not paying them enough or even firing them, mad at their spouses and children for always needing money to pay the rent or having unplanned expenses, and mad at themselves for getting themselves in the situation.  Individuals who can’t manage their anger might be at risk for migraines, heart diseases, and even intermittent explosive disorder. Therapy sessions with a counselor can help you to sort out your emotions and help you realize that while anger is a normal reaction, you need to overcome it so that you can take concrete steps in fixing your financial problems.BargainingWhen people feel vulnerable, they try to regain control by doing a series of  “if only” statements like “if only I did not get that second credit card” or “if only I’d realize my situation earlier.”  This is an attempt of the person to bargain with the situation. People also feel a lot of guilt at this stage, especially if they feel they have disappointed their loved ones because of their financial situation.  Counselling can help you to stop thinking about “what if” statements and start talking about “what is” the situation.DepressionAfter weeks of denying, feeling anxious, and getting mad at everyone, all the negative emotions can pile up which can lead to depression.  In fact, mental illnesses such as depression are three times more likely to occur when a person is in debt. In most cases, individuals who are in debt, broke, or unemployed feel hopeless about their situation and have low self-esteem. Seeking counselling help at this point is a given as individuals may be a danger to themselves or to individuals around them.  AcceptanceAt some point, the individual will need to accept the situation, and the next step is to take an active role in solving the problem. Look at your debt and try to reduce your monthly expenses. You may need to seek professional assistance from credit counselors to help you sort out your financial situation and a counselor to help you sort out yourself.Financial problems can spiral out of control and can become the fuel for mental health conditions such as anxiety disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, or depression.  The key is to accept the reality of the situation and seek professional help.

When you are sharing  your thoughts and feeling by facebook, msn, text-messaging, emailing,  etc – you are doing a form of journaling. According to a recent  article in Scientific American Mind, personal writing gives us a number  of benefits in addition to exercising our fingers. In particular, we can  get some distance from our feelings through seeing the words we have  written from the position of a third-person observer, rather than a  first-person experience. And according to Sigmund Freud, releasing  blocked emotions -- aka catharsis -- leads, at least in the long term,  to healing – in much the same way that airing an infection does.Wait.  There’s more! University of Texas at Austin psychologist and researcher  James Pennebaker contends that regular journaling strengthens immune  cells, called T-lymphocytes. Other research indicates that journaling  decreases the symptoms of asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. Pennebaker  believes that writing about stressful events helps you come to terms  with them, thus reducing the impact of these stressors on your physical  health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmediate Benefits \nMaud Purcell at Psych Central maintains you don’t have to wait for benefits. What are the immediate paybacks? You…1.\tClarify your thoughts and feelings.  Do you ever seem all jumbled up inside, unsure of what you want or  feel? Taking a few minutes to jot down your thoughts and emotions (no  editing!) will quickly get you in touch with your internal world. 2.\tKnow yourself better. By writing routinely you will get to  know what makes you feel happy and confident. You will also become  clear about situations and people who are toxic for you — important  information for your emotional well-being.3.\tReduce stress.  Writing about anger, sadness and other painful emotions helps to  release the intensity of these feelings. By doing so you will feel  calmer and better able to stay in the present.4.\tSolve problems more effectively. Typically  we problem solve from a left-brained, analytical perspective. But  sometimes the answer can only be found by engaging right-brained  creativity and intuition. Writing unlocks these other capabilities, and  affords the opportunity for unexpected solutions to seemingly unsolvable  problems.Maud concludes that in addition to all of these  wonderful benefits, keeping a journal allows you to track patterns,  trends and improvement and growth over time. When current circumstances  appear insurmountable, you will be able to look back on previous  dilemmas that you have since resolved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrefer to journal or blog-in-privacy on line?\nwww.my-diary.org\n\n\n\nFurther Reading and Videos \nBooks \"Writing to Save Your Life: : How to Honor Your Story Through Journaling\" by Michele Weldon, Hazelden, 2001  \"Writing and Being:  Embracing Your Life Through Creative Journaling\", by G.

            "ording to a recent  article in Scientific American Mind, personal writing gives us a number  of benefits in addition to exercising our fingers. In particular, we can  get some distance from our feelings through seeing the words we have  written from the position of a third-person observer, rather than a  first-person experience.

University of Texas at Austin psychologist and researcher  James Pennebaker contends that regular journaling strengthens immune  cells, called T-lymphocytes.

Writing about anger, sadness and other painful emotions helps to  release the intensity of these feelings. By doing so you will feel  calmer and better able to stay in the present.4.\tSolve problems more effectively. Typically  we problem solve from a left-brained, analytical perspective.

Insomnia Disorder exists as its own diagnosis in the DSM V, and as a comorbid condition with other psychiatric diagnoses. An effective treatment plan for clients who have insomnia may include a combination of therapies, medications and lifestyle changes. Therapists should keep pace with the most advanced  and recent therapeutic treatments for insomnia to help clients achieve better outcomes of care. Overcoming Nightmares with Imagery Rehearsal TherapyPersistent nightmares can disrupt sleep and cause a fear aversion to falling asleep at night. People who have  PTSD and anxiety disorder frequently report experiencing vivid, frightening dreams that affect sleep quality. Nightmare Disorder is categorized as one of 11 sleep-wake disorders in the DSM V, however, it frequently contributes to and exacerbates Insomnia Disorder. Imagery Rehearsal Therapy is a form of CBT, which focuses on revisiting central themes in the narrative of recurring nightmares and imagining favorable alternative outcomes. The concept of exercising control over dream states is nothing new; reports of lucid dreaming date back to 1000 BCE and can occur spontaneously. IRT borrows elements from lucid dreaming, and is a controlled writing exercise, performed under the guidance of an experienced therapist. The process of IRT involves recording the content of a disturbing, recurring nightmare, then rewriting the story with a  positive ending. Before falling asleep, the client reads their rewritten version of the dream as a guide to overcome the nightmare. Conditioning Sleep with Stimulus Control Therapy Stimulus Control Therapy focuses on behavioral changes for treating insomnia, and strengthening cues associated with bedtime and the bedroom. Conditioning a sleep response involves eliminating distracting stimuli from the sleep environment, and building associations of peace and restfulness.  Guidelines for stimulus control therapy include spending no more than 20 minutes lying awake in bed, avoiding behaviors that reward staying awake, like late night eating and TV watching, skipping naps and maintaining consistent waking time. The bedroom should be a designated space for sleep and intimacy; activities like working, exercising and  eating should take place outside the bedroom.Mindfulness Practice and Meditation to Reduce StressMindfulness meditation is designed to promote relaxation and bring non-judgmental awareness to the present moment. Engaging the senses and focusing on breathing patterns are common techniques in mindfulness practice. Stress and anxiety can be a root cause for insomnia and other sleep disorders; meditation as a coping mechanism for stress can make it easier to  fall asleep. Introduce your clients to mindful meditation with guided exercises and encourage them to practice these techniques on their own before falling asleep. ​Treating insomnia can be complex and often involves a team of specialists, including physicians, psychiatrists and therapists. Maintain communication with the rest of your client’s treatment team and adapt a dynamic approach to care. Fortunately, there are a variety of therapies available and new therapies emerging for successfully treating insomnia.Picture from https://www.pexels.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

After someone passes, you are not only mourning the loss of a loved one; you now have to deal with the aftermath, including funeral arrangements, accounts, and various legal obligations that you’d much rather put off until never. For seniors, this can be an area of confusion, leaving them feeling overwhelmed and unsure of what to do next. If your senior loved one has recently lost a spouse, here are some suggestions on how to help, courtesy of Basic Counseling Skills. Your role in this process can help your loved one grieve and process their loss, instead of worrying about the details. Make Preparations The first step you need to take is to notify all immediate family members. Your loved one is already emotional, possibly in denial, and having to speak about the death aloud could be difficult, if not impossible. Contact family members to allow them to arrange for time off work for travel, as well as to share important information about decisions regarding funeral arrangements and burial wishes. If your loved one didn’t leave any advanced instructions, you’ll need to sit down and consider what they would want, what is realistic, and what you can afford. The best decision will enable everyone’s heart to heal as best as it can. Talk with your senior about what might be appropriate. Perhaps they remember their spouse mentioning a particular song they would like played or an outfit they preferred to be buried in. The funeral is the first significant action in the grieving process, so your loved one should be comfortable with all aspects of it. If specifics were not made beforehand, here are some questions to consider:Will the body be embalmed, cremated, or donated?If cremated, will the ashes be kept in an urn, mausoleum, or scattered?If buried, what type of headstone?Where is the burial site?Would your loved one prefer an open or closed casket?Are there religious traditions that need to be incorporated?Is there a charity or organization you would prefer contributions to be made to in lieu of flowers?Does your loved one qualify for veteran benefits?  Handle the Numbers Set up a folder for your loved ones with all the important documents they may need such as: death certificate (at least 10 copies), insurance policies, social security numbers, marriage certificate, will, and list of assets. These documents will be necessary to file for benefits and to finalize the estate. If their spouse paid into Social Security for at least 40 quarters, your loved one is eligible to claim Social Security benefits to help with current and future expenses. For example, there is a one-time death benefit to go toward burial expenses as well as survivor’s benefits for those ages 60 and older. If your loved one’s spouse was a veteran or currently employed, it is possible that your loved one is eligible for veteran and employee benefits as well. Any benefits will help, as there are several taxes that may have to be paid such as a federal estate tax, state death tax, inheritance tax, and income taxes. Keep in mind that every situation is different and some taxes may not apply. While you are dealing with the financial side, don’t forget about changing ownership/title, as well as revising documents. Insurance policies, bank accounts, stocks, bonds, and credit cards should either be placed in your senior loved ones name, updated, or canceled. The executor of the estate will handle any debts owed by the deceased. Additionally, you should consider the option of setting up a nonprofit in the name of the deceased. Online guides can help you get started, and the nonprofit has the advantage of honoring your departed loved one while also giving the bereaved something positive on which to focus their energies. They may also find that there are financial benefits that can help them enjoy retirement and their golden years with less of a monetary struggle. Keep a Watchful Eye According to Western Reserve Grief Services, your loved one should refrain from making any major life or financial decisions such as moving, selling their home, or quitting a job immediately after the loss of their partner. Proper grieving takes time, and your loved one needs to be in a more stable state of mind before making such large changes. Keep an eye on your loved one to ensure that they are taking care of themselves, as grief can quickly turn into something more serious, such as depression, anxiety, or addiction. If you notice any changes in your loved one such as extreme sadness, crying spells, irritability, mood changes, or unusual behavior, encourage them to speak with a doctor or let their family doctor know of the situation. It is common for grieving individuals to want to withdraw, but that is actually the worst thing for them to do. This is not to say that being alone is bad. In fact, the bereaved should take time to process their emotions. But being social with friends, family, and loved ones can help bring them out of the depths of grief and back into feeling alive. After some time has passed, consider encouraging your loved one to reach out to old friends and even buddies from high school to help them feel connected and rebuild their social connections. It can be as simple as searching online for alumni from Tucson, Arizona and scrolling through a list of names. The kind of resources your grieving loved finds helpful will vary depending on their beliefs, attitudes, and history. Professional services are always recommended, as mental health specialists have special training in grief. If your loved one was a spiritual person, encourage them to reach out to members of their church or organization. Many have grief support groups or mentorships that can help the grieving individual to process the meaning behind their partner’s death, and their purpose moving forward. Death and grief are complicated, but it is important that you try to be there for your senior loved one during this time. Help them with preparations and making necessary document changes. Check in with them to ensure they are taking care of themselves, but don’t forget to watch your own health as well. Be a source of support for each other as you navigate this new season of life.

Common triggers include speaking in public, eating in front of someone, meeting new people, going on a date and even going to school or work. The physical symptoms, such as sweating, trembling, stomach problems, dry mouth, dizziness and blushing can often help fuel the anxiety. The emotional symptoms include fear, panic attacks and negative emotional cycles. Part of being a counsellor is not just to help clients conquer their anxieties through therapy and CBT techniques. It is also to take a holistic approach and consider how fitness and diet can help in the battle against worry and anxiety.  Considering medicationIn more serious cases when severe social anxiety is inhibiting someone from living an ordinary life where they can go to work or do their shopping, then anxiety medication can be prescribed. Before this, however, it is worth considering how diet can affect mood. Research has found that having a healthy diet that is rich in the nutrients, vitamins and minerals, can help reduce anxiety. It is also worth considering taking a regular nootropic supplement to improve vitamin intake. Nootropics that contain zinc, omega-3 and the B-vitamins can be particularly effective to help boost mood. Cutting out negative foods It is important to cut down on sugar, alcohol and caffeine, if you want to combat social anxiety, which all affect mood levels drastically. They can all mimic the symptoms of anxiety, including the shakes and heart palpitations. It is worth considering that many brands of soda contain high levels of caffeine and sugar, so these should be swapped for water. Many people that are living with anxiety will drink alcohol in an attempt to calm their nerves. This isn’t advisable — not only is alcohol a depressant, but in the long term, alcoholism comes with its own set of issues, both emotionally and physically. Keeping A Food DiaryIt is worth asking your client to keep a food diary of what they are eating and when they are eating it. You can then assess whether diet could be contributing to their anxiety. Ultimately you want your client to get to the stage where they are eating three well-balanced meals a day, that have all the vitamins and minerals they need to boost mood, helping them to cope with everyday situations. The timing of these meals is also important — eating dinner too late in the evening can cause weight gain and digestive issues. It is worth suggesting to your client that they follow a simple Mediterranean diet that is free from additives, colorings and refined sugar and you can even devise a meal plan with them with healthy suggestions for alternatives to high-calorie snacks.  ​When social anxiety is affecting how a person can function on a daily basis then counselling can be an enormous help. You will need to look at not just the initial symptoms, but take a holistic approach, assessing both the emotional and physical triggers. Changes in diet will help to keep the body fit and healthy, improving mood and helping balance the response to everyday social situations. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

You will also have an opportunity to \"listen in\" on a number of sample sessions to see how all of these counseling skills work together.Note: I use the words \"counselor\" and \"listener\" interchangeably; also \"client\" and \"speaker.\" What follows are some simple descriptions. For more information and practice ideas, click on the appropriate buttons on the left hand site. The pictures on the right hand side of this section's pages serve as topic illustrations.The large pics at the bottom will always have a cat. Why? Because Sigmund Freud - physiologist, medical doctor, psychologist and father of psychoanalysis, and who is generally recognized as one of the most influential and authoritative thinkers of the twentieth century - loved cats!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Terms\nThe pattern of sessions  has a predictable rhythm with an introduction, information gathering, discussion and a conclusion.   Active listening  happens when you \"listen for  meaning\". The listener says very little but conveys much interest. The  listener only speaks to find out if a statement (or two or twenty) has  been correctly heard and understood.    Body language  takes into account our facial  expressions, angle of our body, proximity of ourself to another,  placement of arms and legs, and so much more. Notice how much can be  expressed by raising and lowering your eyebrows!  You need to monitor the tone of your voice  - in  the same way that you monitor your body language. Remember, the person  may not remember what was said, but they will remember how you made them  feel! \n\n\n\n\n\nAn  open question  is one that is used in order to gathering lots of information – you ask it with the intent of getting a long answer. A closed question  is one used to gather specific information - it can normally be  answered with either a single word or a short phrase. Good counseling  techniques to know!  Paraphrasing  is when you restate what the  speaker said.  Often different words are used and the listener may be  using this to draw attention to a particular concern or aspect.  Sometimes paraphrasing is used to clarify.   Summarizing  is focusing on the main points of a  presentation or conversation in order to highlight them.  At the same  time you are giving the “gist”, you are checking to see if you are  accurate. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nNotetaking  is the practice of writing down pieces  of information, often in an shorthand and messy manner. The listener  needs to be discreet and not disturb the flow of thought, speech or body  language of the speaker.   Homework?  Absolutely!  When the person  identifies a need or concern, she or he must be willing to work hard at  addressing it. This is much like what you are doing right now. You want  to learn counseling techniques, so you are going to study and practice  these basic skills!  The Goodie Bag and Other Fun and Informative Stuff help make a counseling session an occasion for joy, as well as for additional learning. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting It All Together\nOnce you have reviewed Counseling Techniques I encourage you to \"listen  in\" on Sample Sessions One and Four - to see how these could be used in  an initial and subsequent visit.   One - Client Centered (Carl Rogers)   Four - Strength Based (Positive Thinking / Learned Optimism)  After reviewing Counseling Techniques and Sample Sessions One and Four, it will be time to study common   Counseling Theories.  It will truly be \"very interesting!\" (A Freud quote.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime spent with cats is never wasted. - Sigmund Freud  \n\n\n\n\nBuy  at AllPosters.com\n\n\n\n\nTAKE ME TO THE TOP OF THE PAGE!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

After the usual intro…Mary: “I’m quite excited. I did  email back and forth with www.asknow.com and there may be a possibility  for work for Andy in Korea in an ‘internship.’ Can you believe that?!”Joan: “I didn’t know about that. Thank you so much for letting me know. What does Andy think about this?”Mary:  “He’s already started the paper work. The cat and dog we can take with  us – Sarah loves my guinea pig anyway so is happy to take him. And I’m  hoping she’ll take the cockateil too. She’s really sad about the  possibility of me going away – but she’s in year three of the four year  program. So maybe next year…”Joan: “And there’s internet and internet phone and camera too.”Mary:  “Duh! I know! But you know, all of this has got me really thinking.  Last week I was at my wits end and so was Andy. This week I am way up  there – I’ve got a future, so does Andy. Plus an adventure.”Joan: “Uh huh…”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMary: “So what’s this all about? Life I mean. How can life be really  good and really bad all in one week. Why do some people have choices in  life like Andy and I do, and some spend their entire lives trying to get  their next meal.”Joan: “What do you think?!”Mary: “I  don’t know. I think I’m experiencing existential angst!” (grins) On the  one hand, as a Catholic, I believe God has a plan or a purpose for  everyone’s life. But how do I know that? And what kind of God plans for  some to have ‘the good life’ and others to live in wretchedness.Joan: “These are big questions for sure.”Mary:  “Part of me is feeling guilty for having hope. When I felt hopeless I  didn’t have the energy to think about others. When this Korean thing  looked like a reality I thanked God – and I still do. But then I had to  ask, ‘Why me?’ Is it luck-of-the-draw and God isn’t really involved at  all? Or is it all predetermined?\"Joan: (Puts on her “active listening hat.”) “So on the one hand you feel hope and yet you have lots of questions…” Mary: “Didn’t I just say that! Those weren’t rhetorical questions! I really want to know what you think!?”Joan:  (Puts on her “existential counseling hat”.) “OK…well…taking a Christian  frame work – because you are one – I think it’s possible that the  ‘Higher Power’ cares enough to create and give principles to live by.  And then lets us go from there.”Mary: “So God has moved away?!” Joan:  “No. Again, using your framework, God is there and cares and you can  count on God’s spiritual support. But you can’t ask God to take the  blame for the situations humans have made. Or bail them out each and  every time.”Mary: “It doesn’t seem very fair. Some people make  the lives of others wretched and God doesn’t stop them; others have to  live with the results of that – and God doesn’t save them. It feels  pretty hopeless sometimes…”Joan: “Have you heard of Viktor  Frankl? He was a concentration camp and survived – and he has said two  things I hold very dear. Now you have to remember that almost his entire  family was murdered by the Nazis. He said, ‘He who understands the  ‘why’ can bear most any ‘how’. And that no matter what is taken away  from us, we still have the ability to choose how we will think, feel and  behave. His approach is called ‘Existential Counseling / Therapy’ or  ‘Logotherapy.’”Mary: “Ok so that accounts for the quotation you have on the college website... Happiness,  cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended  side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than  oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than  oneself. – Viktor Frankl...I don’t see how teaching in Korea is part of this.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoan:  “It comes back to that sense of cause or purpose  again. Mary, what do  you think are your gifts? Where does the world  need you right now and in  the future?”Mary:  “I don’t know that I am a teacher – but I  guess I’ll have to be. I am a  good student of history. You know the  saying, ‘If you ignore the  lessons of history, you are bound to repeat  them.’”Joan: “What about the guerilla gardening? How could that tie into Korea?”Mary: “Good point. I’ll have a chance to explore Korean gardening and floral arranging first hand, won’t I!?”Joan:   “How did that motto go, ‘Let's fight the filth with forks and  flowers.’  Reminds me of the phrase, ‘Bomb them with butter!' – the idea  being is  that people who are well cared for are less likely to attack  you. And if  they do, hopefully it will be with cream cheese!” (Both  laugh.)Mary: “This whole thing has opened up more questions than it has answers.”Joan: “You mean the going to Korea thing?”Mary:   “That but also this counseling thing. I mean having to look closely at   your own life and then trying to find a ‘higher purpose.’ I don’t know   whether to laugh or throw up!”Joan: “I feel that way most of the time!” (Both laugh some more.)Session Eight with Existential Counseling winds down...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourage is not the absence of despair; it is, rather, the capacity to move ahead in spite of despair.- Rollo May \n\n\n\n\nBuy  at AllPosters.com\n\n\n\n\nTAKE ME TO THE TOP OF THIS PAGE!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

After the usual intro…Mary: “I’m quite excited. I did  email back and forth with www.asknow.",

What does Andy think about this?”Mary:  “He’s already started the paper work. The cat and dog we can take with  us – Sarah loves my guinea pig anyway so is happy to take him. And I’m  hoping she’ll take the cockateil too. She’s really sad about the  possibility of me going away – but she’s in year three of the four year ",
            " program. So maybe next year…”Joan: “And there’s internet and internet phone and camera too.”Mary:  “Duh! I know! But you know, all of this has got me really thinking.  Last week I was at my wits end and so was Andy. This week I am way up  there – I’ve got a future, so does Andy. Plus an adventure.”Joan: “Uh huh…”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMary: “So what’s this all about? Life I mean. How can life be really  good and really bad all in one week. Why do some people have choices in  life like Andy and I do, and som",
            "e spend their entire lives trying to get  their next meal.”Joan: “What do you think?!”Mary: “I  don’t know. I think I’m experiencing existential angst!” (grins) On the  one hand, as a Catholic, I believe God has a plan or a purpose for  everyone’s life. But how do I know that? And what kind of God plans for  some to have ‘the good life’ and others to live in wretchedness.Joan: “These are big questions for sure.”Mary:  “Part of me is feeling guilty for having hope. When I felt hopeless I  didn’t ",
            "have the energy to think about others. When this Korean thing  looked like a reality I thanked God – and I still do. But then I had to  ask, ‘Why me?’ Is it luck-of-the-draw and God isn’t really involved at  all? Or is it all predetermined?\"Joan: (Puts on her “active listening hat.”) “So on the one hand you feel hope and yet you have lots of questions…” Mary: “Didn’t I just say that! Those weren’t rhetorical questions! I really want to know what you think!?”Joan:  (Puts on her “existential couns",
            "eling hat”.) “OK…well…taking a Christian  frame work – because you are one – I think it’s possible that the  ‘Higher Power’ cares enough to create and give principles to live by.  And then lets us go from there.”Mary: “So God has moved away?!” Joan:  “No. Again, using your framework, God is there and cares and you can  count on God’s spiritual support. But you can’t ask God to take the  blame for the situations humans have made. Or bail them out each and  every time.”Mary: “It doesn’t seem very ",
            "fair. Some people make  the lives of others wretched and God doesn’t stop them; others have to  live with the results of that – and God doesn’t save them. It feels  pretty hopeless sometimes…”Joan: “Have you heard of Viktor  Frankl? He was a concentration camp and survived – and he has said two  things I hold very dear. Now you have to remember that almost his entire  family was murdered by the Nazis. He said, ‘He who understands the  ‘why’ can bear most any ‘how’. And that no matter what is tak",

His approach is called ‘Existential Counseling / Therapy’ or  ‘Logotherapy.’”Mary: “Ok so that accounts for the quotation you have on the college website... Happiness,  cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended  side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than  oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than  oneself. – Viktor Frankl...I ",
            "don’t see how teaching in Korea is part of this.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoan:  “It comes back to that sense of cause or purpose  again. Mary, what do  you think are your gifts? Where does the world  need you right now and in  the future?”Mary:  “I don’t know that I am a teacher – but I  guess I’ll have to be. I am a  good student of history. You know the  saying, ‘If you ignore the  lessons of history, you are bound to repeat  them.’”Joan: “What about the guerilla gardening? How could that tie into Korea?”Mar",
            "y: “Good point. I’ll have a chance to explore Korean gardening and floral arranging first hand, won’t I!?”Joan:   “How did that motto go, ‘Let's fight the filth with forks and  flowers.’  Reminds me of the phrase, ‘Bomb them with butter!' – the idea  being is  that people who are well cared for are less likely to attack  you. And if  they do, hopefully it will be with cream cheese!” (Both  laugh.)Mary: “This whole thing has opened up more questions than it has answers.”Joan: “You mean the going ",

I mean having to look closely at   your own life and then trying to find a ‘higher purpose.’ I don’t know   whether to laugh or throw up!”Joan: “I feel that way most of the time!” (Both laugh some more.)Session Eight with Existential Counseling winds down...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourage is not the absence of despair; it is, rather, the capacity to move ahead in spite of despair.- Rollo May \n\n\n\n\nBuy  at AllPosters.com\n\n\n\n\nTAKE ME TO THE TOP OF THIS",

Setting up a budget, staying on top of your bills and living within your means – it can all pay off. It’s a good feeling being in control of your finances. And managing money is a skill we should all have – but it’s often something we’re not taught at school. For most of us, we learn as we go, and this could involve a few costly mistakes.Financial pressures can affect all of us. We’ve all reached the end of the month struggling to make ends meet. But without action, it’s easy for bad habits to form and problems to snowball. The link between money and mental health or wellbeing is a complex one.Worrying about money can make our mental health worse, but poor mental wellbeing can also make it harder to manage finances. It can affect people in different ways, but starting to understand your behaviour can help you make responsible choices.You can view the full article here: https://finty.com/resources/managing-money-pressures/Photo from ​https://unsplash.com/photos/Pe4gh8a8mBY \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Borck, Stephen B. Fawcett) - open and closed - is an important tool in the counseling kit.  They can help a person open up or close them down.    An open question is one that is used in order to gathering lots of information – you ask it with the intent of getting a long answer. A closed question  is one used to gather specific information - it can normally be  answered with either a single word or a short phrase. Good basic counsel  skills to know! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen-Ended Questions (OEQs) have no correct answer and require  an explanation of sorts.  The who-what-where-why-when-how questions  your English teacher taught you to ask?  Little did she know you’d be  using them for asking questions in counseling! Here are some good ones:•\tWhat brought you in here today?•\tDo you have an idea about why this keeps happening?•\tWhat is your Plan B?•\tHow does that make you feel?You’ll  notice that I didn’t use “why?” directly.  This is because some people  find it threatening and overwhelming.  It implies judgment and it can be  asking an unanswerable question.  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOpen Ended Questions are great for:•\tStarting the information gathering part of the session•\tKeeping the client talking\n\n\n\nClosed Questions (CQs) are those that can easily be answered with a “yes” or a “no” or brief information.  For example:•\tWhat is your name and date of birth?•\tDid you call the health practitioner to set up a physical?•\tWhere do you work?  Occupation?•\tAre you ready to stop doing that?!They sound a little harsh, but are needed:•\tFor getting necessary information•\tTo get bring a chatty client back on track or interrupt her/him.You’re  going to take a few minutes right now and practice asking questions!   Don’t worry, asking questions will soon be as natural as breathing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Class Homework - Trying Out Open Ended Questions (OEQs) and Closed Questions (CQs): 10 minutes of questioning and 5 minutes of feedbackListener - Get ready to actively listen and get into your encouraging body language.  Ask  an OEQ like, “Was there anything particularly interesting that happened  within the past few days?”  You want them to go on at some length.Speaker - Talk away!After  a few minutes, the listener can try to constrain or redirect  conversation by asking a CQ such as “Does this make you feel good or  bad?”  You are looking for an either/or answer.Listener, ask another OEQ, followed by a CQ a few minutes later. Speaker, be helpful, ok? :)*****Listener1. How does it feel to be on the receiving end of an OEQ?2. What impression did you have when asked a CQ?Speaker1. Was it easy or difficult to ask OEQs?2. How about CQs?You may have noticed that quiet people need lots of OEQs and chatty people need more CQs!***** Out of Class HomeworkBe very conscious of asking  questions - the kinds you ask and why you do so?  Notice how you feel  when asked an Open or Closed question? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA major stimulant to creative thinking is focused questions. There is  something about a well-worded question that often penetrates to the  heart of the matter and triggers new ideas and insights. - Brian Tracy\n\n\n\n\nBuy  at AllPosters.com\n\n\n\n\ntake me to the top of the page!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Doing so might be helpful when exploring triggers and solutions for particular moods. Here are a few activities to consider trying if you could do with a bit of emotional support.Get into sewing​A study in the Journal of Public Health showed the positive effects of quilting on participants’ mental health. Whether it be putting together a patchwork quilt or sewing someone a piece of clothing, the impact on your morale can be extremely worthwhile. The good news is that it is never too late to start learning how to quilt. There is opportunities available for all newcomers to needlework. Engaging with a creative and challenging activity, as well as learning a new skill, gave participants in the study an enhanced morale boost. The positive impact of color was also significant. Finally, seeing the fruits of your labor at the end is of course inherently rewarding.Sing your heart outThe health benefits of music are numerous. Music lowers your heart rate and blood pressure, helping to relieve anxiety in the process and release endorphins (the ‘happy hormones’). This is particularly true in the case of singing, the deep breathing during which helps to relax the mind and make you feel more relaxed. Singing in a choir, meanwhile, is thought to naturally boost people’s sense of belonging, as well as their overall state of mind. Whether singing on your own or as part of a group, it is worth trying to make singing a regular feature of your day-to-day life; the feel-good factor is powerful to say the least.Try the creative craft of woodworkIt may come as a surprise to hear about the morale-boosting qualities of woodwork. Like music, working with natural wood can lower blood pressure and stress levels. Scientists believe that this is due to the relative warmth of wood and its link to nature. Nature has a positive impact on our mood, as well as on things like focus and memory. In this way, woodwork brings together creativity and nature, making for a powerful combination when it comes to our emotional wellbeing. What is more, just as with quilting, woodworking offers you the chance to learn a new skill and experience the reward of creating something with your own hands.There are lots of ways to be creative It is always worth considering help from a counselor or other trained professional if you are experiencing sustained levels of stress. In addition to this, though, carving out time for yourself to be creative could have a significantly positive impact. Whether it be any of the activities listed above or others that you personally feel drawn to, having that outlet in which to express yourself could give you the vital boost you need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I pray for my kids every day and contact the ones who live away at least once a week.6.\tOK daughter. I call home regularly and have taught my kids to respect their grandparents.  7.\tModel employee.  I always do extra and am very concerned about my co-workers as well as my clients.8.\tExcellent student. I am always learning something new – on purpose.9.\tHave a four inch smile.  In fact, I once won a smiling contest.10.\tGenerous.  I support many good causes with my time, talent and treasure and prayer.11.\tDetermined. I have experienced my share of disappointments but I always come back for the count.12.\tWhole hog. I don’t do anything by halves. If I am going to do something, I jump right in. 13.\tVegan, which is gentle on the earth as well as the other-than-human animals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow It's Your TurnThe Ten (Or More) Things I Like About Me\n\nBy __________ – 2___ 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.***Bonus Points***11.12.13.\n\n\n\n\nPeacing It Together\nOnce you have written this out, I want you to add a picture of  something that makes you feel happy just to look at it. I have a passion  for peace hence the very real photo of the lioness,  Little Tyke , with her friend the lamb, Becky. *****Next, I’d like you  to print off a few copies, put each in a plastic sheet protector, and  put it in places where you will see it.

For others, it provides mental and social stimulation, preventing feelings of isolation or low self worth.  Perhaps you’ve revisited your goals for this chapter of your life and are considering whether you could be a good counselor.  Here’s why older counselors can add real value to their clients.Empathy from experienceStudies have shown that older people may be more motivated to help others and to show emotional empathy, than members of the younger generation.  That’s not to say a retiree will have endless patience, but it is often easier to empathize and understand people’s feelings, worries and anxieties if you’ve lived a little and made a few mistakes along the way.  Coming into counseling with more life experience can make you a more self-aware counselor, as well as helping you to listen non-judgmentally to your clients.Client commitmentAt a time when the culture of being busy is so popular - nearly half of all Millennials are so-called “work martyrs” - retirees have a huge advantage in that they are generally less committed elsewhere.  This means that they can give their clients the physical and mental time and flexibility they need. This is only really possible when your own children are raised, you feel more personally fulfilled, your mortgage is paid off and you’re building your nest egg so you can enjoy this chapter of life.  Older counselors can have a wonderful sense of freedom, which in turn filters through to clients.Professional know-howOne huge advantage of coming to counselling as a second or late-life career is that you bring the benefit of professional experience with you.  Whatever your previous employment experience, there will be transferable skills or knowledge gained which you can use to your clients’ advantage.  Whether it’s the ability to set achievable objectives, honed problem solving skills, or simply being at ease with building a rapport with a variety of people, lessons learned in the workplace can be very useful in becoming an effective counselor.  Clients are also more likely to respect your breadth of knowledge and see how you can add real value to their situation.If, like so many of those approaching retirement age, you’re open to a new adventure, counseling could be an excellent opportunity.  If you enjoy listening to others, offering a non-judgmental ear and helping to place them on a path to solutions, then you may find it to be a hugely rewarding career.  Your clients will gain a lot too, from the benefit of your experiences gained over the years, both in and out of the workplace. Your golden years could be a real time to shine, adding a little light and warmth to other people’s lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

According to McKinsey consumer research, skincare sales were up by 300 percent in 2020, compared to previous years. This increase reflects the buying patterns across generations, with 74 percent of Baby Boomers, 49 percent of Gen X'ers, 44 percent of Millennials, and 32 percent of Gen Z'ers buying more skincare products from stores. Before, having a skincare routine was thought to be a sign of vanity, but these days, having one has become normalized, regardless of gender, race, age, or economic status, and it has become an intrinsic part of self-care. Encouraging a client to care for their skin won't only improve their appearance: it can also have tremendous benefits for mental wellbeing.It provides a comforting, stabilizing routineIn 2020, most people experienced a drastic change in their daily routines. According to one study, people who have less consistent routines throughout their day are more likely to experience loneliness and have mood problems, compared to people who follow routines. Making the time to properly care for yourself, such as by going for a bi-monthly gel manicure, having a monthly facial, or following a daily skincare routine, can all help to provide some stability to life, and create some distinction between days. Having routines to create some semblance of order and normalcy can be comforting, especially during trying times. These activities all build in down time naturally too, which is also important for mental health. During your manicure, for example, you will need to wait for your gel polish to cure under the LED or UV lamp as it won't dry naturally, and this is the perfect time for a relaxing cup of tea and some quiet reflection.It's a good way to boost moodDoing something that feels good, such as applying a soothing face mask or lotion, or massaging your face with a jade roller, can boost your mood and make you feel happier. It can also have a calming effect, helping you to sleep better at night and reduce anxiety during the day. To make the most of the mood-boosting effect of a skincare routine, it's important not to rush through it, and you must commit to doing each step thoroughly, from cleansing to moisturizing. Doing so not only maximizes the efficacy of skincare products, but it also helps you to physically relax and minimize stress. It increases your self-esteemAbout 85 percent of people have low self-esteem, and not having enough confidence can have a detrimental effect on a person's quality of life. Luckily, anyone can increase their self-esteem by adding more self-care into their daily routine. By spending 5 to 10 minutes taking care of your skin, you're sending a message to yourself that you're worthy of love and kindness. Diligently following a skincare routine also gives you a feeling of accomplishment, which can increase your confidence even more. You don't have to buy expensive products to feel better about yourself - even inexpensive skincare products from the drugstore can have a positive impact on your self-worth, especially if they're the right ones for your skin type. A good skincare routine can work wonders beyond the surface of our skin. Consider creating a skincare routine, and encourage clients to have one as well, for better skin and improved mental health. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

At the same time, the abuse, misuse or overuse of prescription medication for pain is considered a growing problem, with the 2016 National Study on Drug Use and Health reporting that one in 10 people struggle with some level of substance abuse, including an addiction to prescription drugs. Counseling can help those in the process of rehabilitation, with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and other natural approaches such as meditation often forming part of a multi-faceted approach to recovery.The treatment approach depends on the type of painAs noted in a study published in the journal Psychiatry by D Songer, “Psychotherapeutic approaches to patients in pain vary depending on whether the patient is suffering from acute, continuous, or chronic pain.” Acute pain can often be treated with pain medication, but there are specific conditions in which pain can become chronic. These include dental issues, especially for persons in lower economic brackets who can rely on Medicaid and other aid programs mainly for emergency needs. Additional conditions causing chronic pain include osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, cancer, multiple sclerosis, stomach ulcers, AIDS, and gallbladder disease. Chronic pain can often be accompanied by depression and anxiety, so therapists need to assess all possible conditions before deciding on a definitive treatment plan.CBT a gold standard therapyOne of the most effective therapies for chronic pain is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), in which, during counseling sessions, therapists highlight the inexorable link between thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. CBT often involves homework; asking patients to undertake specific behaviors, for instance, when they feel pain. Therapists enlighten patients on the kind of ‘automatic thoughts’ that can lead to more pain. These thoughts include ‘I’m getting much worse’, ‘I’ll never be able to have a normal life’ and other self-defeating statements. Therapists enlighten patients on what to do when these automatic thoughts arise. Patients are often asked to keep a journal listing down the triggers for stronger feelings of pain. Realizing the power of these thoughts, patients can take steps to take alternative action when they arise in their mind.Yoga and meditationHolistic exercises such as yoga and meditation have been found to lower levels of stress hormone, cortisol, which can exacerbate pain and anxiety.

Counselors need practice too. (This link is to  The Counseling Practicum and Internship Manual: A Resource by Shannon Hodges.) It occasionally happens that a counselor becomed  very attached to a client. She or he is bright, wants to try new things,  complimentary, and considerate. You feel this person has become your  friend – but whereas a counselor can have a friendly in-office  relationship with a client – that’s where it ends. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost professional associations do not endorse  counselor-client relationships outside of the counseling setting, or any  behavior – in or out of the workplace - which may violate professional  boundaries.How do we let go emotionally? Well, how do we  encourage clients to let go? We tell them it’s ok to acknowledge or  grieve a loss – they can talk about it or write about it in a journal or  both. But then at some point it’s time. Somehow something inside of us  says, “Time to stop this now, or at least wind it down somewhat.” What  I find works well in a variety of “loss” situations is to take on  something new – something we might now otherwise have been able to, or  even thought of. In counseling, there is always something or someone new  to “taken on.” There are always more clients than there are counselors,  there are always good causes that need fresh volunteers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClients \nIt can also happen that a client need to be “weaned.” Most clients  will either drop out of counseling or, having down some of the work they  needed to do, be happy to move on. A few will develop new challenges  and you may suspect this is happening because they see you as their  friend or parent – which you are not.  How do they let go emotionally? Give them the space to talk about how it  feels to be at the end of their allotted number of sessions. (They knew  the number at the beginning so this comes as no surprise.) They can  journal. But also build into your “wind-down” session(s) the continuing  need to find and develop social supports.  These can be self-help groups  like Bereavement or AA; it could be a church family or a community  club.The person needs to know that s/he can always drop you a  line by email or snail mail and your former client has from the first  session a list of all the community resources available – mental health  and recreational.I give a graduation gift – a Frisbee! I pick up a  number of these at a local dollar store in a variety of colors. I can  put a fun or inspirational sticker on it. I choose Frisbees because you  can play Frisbee all year long. It gets people outside and you need  another person to do it with. Or several. If my client was a senior, I  would give a craft package that required two people to do it.\n\n\n\nExample\nSee  Final Visit Pattern.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading and Videos \nBooks\"Counseling is Like...\" by Margaret Ross, Trafford Publishing, 2003  VideoVery sweet short clip of a family acting out \"Hello, Goodbye\" by the Beatles.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Alv0YQ52gQ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are things that we never want to be letting go of, people we  never want to leave behind.

Some may have increased muscle tone, others decreased. Some children may be affected on only one side of the body, others only in the leg. Cerebral Palsy CausesThe underlying cause of all cases of cerebral palsy is damage that disrupts the brain’s development. What causes this damage varies by individual and in some cases may not be known. Cerebral Palsy SymptomsThe symptoms of cerebral palsy can vary widely depending on the individual, the type of cerebral palsy and the severity of the brain damage that caused it. The most common symptoms are related to movement and motor function. It is important for parents to know the signs of cerebral palsy so an early diagnosis can be made, followed by treatments and interventions.To learn more go to https://www.cerebralpalsyguidance.com/cerebral-palsy/  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It’s not always rational fear that keeps us up at night, either. Sometimes you can be anxious about something that genuinely isn’t an important issue that will impact your life in any major way. That doesn’t mean that you can’t do your best to control the anxiety and move on with your life as worry-free as possible, of course. Here are a few tips to help you reduce anxiety in 30 minutes or less.1. Write in a journalKeeping a daily log of your feelings and stressors is a great way to gain a better understanding of how anxiety affects you. Sometimes the act of writing itself can be incredibly cathartic and lead to reduced stress levels. Journal entries don’t have to be long—they just need to be honest. Try to find a few minutes in your day to focus on writing down how you’re feeling. Maybe you’ll record a few words or an entire page—the important thing is to acknowledge your feelings in hopes of reducing their impact on your well-being.2. Practice a breathing exerciseWhen you become especially anxious, your body begins to react in physical ways. That includes breathing faster than normal, which can actually increase your anxiety levels and keep the cycle going. The solution? Take a moment and focus on your breathing. You can do this anywhere you happen to be when the anxiety hits. Just turn your attention inward and focus on breathing in and out slowly and deeply. Before long, you should find your anxiety level decreasing.3. Follow a guided meditationAlong the lines of focusing on your breathing, you might consider trying a guided meditation app or two. You can find these on just about any platform imaginable, including online to be used on your computer and in the app stores for both Android and iOS devices. Meditation can help bring anxiety levels down and find peace to go about the rest of your day. The best part is that it doesn’t take long to see results. Most guided meditations are between two and ten minutes long, and they can make a big difference in your mood.4. Make a quick to-do listIf you find that your anxiety tends to rise when you don’t clearly understand exactly what to expect from your day, consider taking some time to make a to-do list. This doesn’t have to take long—just making sure you jot down the priorities of the day. Include things like going to the grocery store, visiting the gym, or replacing your air filter to help keep your life and home fresh.5. Do something you enjoyWhat do you find relaxing and fun? Spend 20–30 minutes on something you enjoy every day. Periods of relaxation lower anxiety, help you feel better, and allow you to get back to your life as quickly as possible. Your schedule can spare you for that length of time and your day will be better for the time spent focusing on something you love.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

When handled responsibly, it can be a way to relax in social situations, celebrate with loved ones, and even decompress after a long day at work. When it’s abused, though, it can be dangerous — drinking can change the way you think and see the world, and it’s not always for the better.People abuse alcohol for all kinds of reasons — financial woes, relationship problems, and trouble at work all tend to be big contributors — and in many different ways. Abuse isn’t always synonymous with alcoholism; even on the weekends is considered abuse. But drinking isn’t the best way to cope with problems, and can even make them appear so massive that ending it all seems like the only way out. In fact, alcohol is a factor in over a quarter of all suicides in the United States and more than a third of suicide victims used alcohol just prior to death.Coping with an alcohol abuse problem and the suicidal tendencies that sometimes accompany it is a slippery slope to say the least. This guide will help to lead the way to cleaner, happier living by outlining the relationship between alcohol abuse and suicidal thoughts and how to overcome both. Keep in mind that while this guide isn’t a substitute for professional help, it can certainly be a positive first step on your road to recovery.Read the rest of this article at https://www.alcoholtreatment.net/suicidal-thoughts-and-alcohol-abuse-tackling-both-problems-head-on/ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

When it’s abused, though, it can be dangerous — drinking can change the way you think and see the world, and it’s not always for the better.People abuse alcohol for all kinds of reasons — financial woes, relationship problems, and trouble at work all tend to be big contributors — and in many different ways. Abuse isn’t always synonymous with alcoholism; even on the weekends is considered abuse.

Unfortunately, unconscious goals can  be self-defeating. You know those six components of whole health I  repeatedly refer to? To flourish, we need to set goals for ourselves in  each component and then implement them.How might this look? Let’s  take our counselor Joan as an example. There have been a number of  challenges for her since her sessions with Mary and she finds herself  feeling…well…futile. She has decided not only to survive (stop negative  thoughts) but to thrive, to take positive steps.  But first she  has to take a baseline on where she is at – and where she wants to go.  And she will need an accountability partner along the way since doing  nothing is easier than doing something.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSix Components of Whole Health \n\nNote: Joan knows these off by heart – but you may want to revisit the  checklist. 1. Physical HealthJoan has put on twenty  pounds and stopped going to the gym. While she still eats nutritious  food in the daytime, she has developed a bad habit of munching potato  chips at her computer at night. She has discovered gin and tonic and the  shots are getting larger. She is sleeping in and while she gets to work  on time, she doesn’t have time breakfast or grooming. She knows massage  therapy is helpful for her – but just hasn’t had the organization (or  energy) to pick up the phone.2. Social HealthAll is  well here. Things are well enough with her hubby and her three kids.  Still, she craves more talk time with all of them – plus her mom who  lives some distance away. She and her hubby get together with their  friends once a month and that is awesome. She tells her gal pal that she  is feeling in the dumps and is happy her friend just listens rather  than telling her to do a list of things. Joan is not ready to act in  any event.  3. Emotional HealthJoan has stopped doing nice  things for herself. Her roots are grey and her hair is shaggy, her  clothes don’t fit but she can’t be bothered getting larger ones. One of  her pastimes used to be walking dogs at the shelter, but she has stopped  even doing that. She spends too much time on the computer.4. Spiritual HealthShe  enjoys her church life well enough and visiting the sick and shut in.  She reads her Bible daily (she is Christian) but reads a lot of junk  too.  Junk in – junk out.  She knows this. But much of her life doesn’t  feel purposeful. She feels on autopilot.5. Intellectual healthShe feels dull. Full stop.6. Occupational healthJoan  has always enjoyed counseling but hoped in the small community health  centre she works in that there would be an opportunity for her to do  management work too. But in fact there have been cutbacks. Her pay is  good enough but she anticipates another round of layoffs and thinks she  could be a casualty. Financially there are fine. Her hubby works as a  millwright in a mine and he likes his job and co-workers.  So  what is her problem?! Joan books some time with a fellow mental health  worker who is in private practice. This person will be her  accountability partner in goal-setting. \n\nPeople who seek change need immediate, short term and long term goals. \nI recommend daily, weekly, monthly and yearly markers as part of goal-setting and achievement. There are a variety of  to-do lists  and  calendars  available at the Microsoft Office On-Line Templates.Daily  – The To-Do List.  As well as doing the things that need to be done,  you need to be incorporating your goals into your day-to-day living. Weekly  – What Things Get Done When. If we slot in the time to work on specific  tasks, as well as to play, we are going to see more progress. Monthly – Taking The Pulse. Have I made any progress in achieving my goals? Yearly – Diploma Time. Have I achieved the goals I planned?  If not, why not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow might goal-setting look for Joan? \n1.

Laur and I have a honorary son - Monty. I am a Registered Social Worker (Retired) with a Masters in Humanities and in the past I worked occasional part-time at Laurentian University's counseling and support program. I am a Commissioned Chaplain through the Mennonite Church of Eastern Canada. I am a friendly visitor and a pastoral care team member at Grace Mennonite Church. I am a vegan and vegan mentor, and enjoy the company of companion animals. I enjoy walking, cycling, swimming, and hiking. Slowly! With lots of pauses. :) I am both a Mennonite and Methodist and have served as a lay preacher and pastoral care visitor at All Peoples United Church in Sudbury. My hubs and I live in St. Catharines, Ontario. We love to visit Sudbury, Ontario in the summer – our home for many years – and Arizona in the winter, if the opportunity arises. Love always! / jan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease visit my other websites.

Although counselors typically receive training on cultural diversity, this basic consciousness does not necessarily result in a proper understanding of what it entails to live in severe poverty. Despite being typically constructive, most training courses for counselors do not cover the important socioeconomic barriers that are prevalent across the world. Due to this, the average counselor often does not possess the necessary know-how when comes to dealing with patients living in poverty. It is imperative that counselors not only understand the impact poverty has on the psyche but also know how to tailor their interactions accordingly.The dire impact of living in povertyApart from encountering countless obstacles that hinder basic survival, living in poverty can also result in a number of secondary concerns that can render therapy substantially less effective. Common concerns stemming from poverty include mental illness, substance abuse, and chronic illness. An individual living below the bread line may, for example, have contracted asthma due to living in a mold-infested room. As a counselor, it is important to not only address the emotional trauma experienced by the patient, but also the individual's physical living situation itself. If the room is filled with bacteria or mold, it is critical to consider how the patient can get their asthma treated and rid the room of the dampness that caused the respiratory distress.The importance of meeting basic needsWhen a person has to constantly worry about where their next meal is going to come from, it becomes increasingly difficult for them to make themselves emotionally available or counseling. Before traditional counseling can commence it is important that a patient’s basic needs are met. A lot of people living in poverty are of the belief that they are being let down by current systems that do not make provision for their basic needs. It is important that counselors are not only sensitive to these needs but try to help meet them as well. Many impoverished individuals live in absolutely horrible circumstances that include limited access to food, clothing, and shelter. While counselors may not have the means to improve the living conditions of a patient themselves, they can help facilitate the necessary assistance to improve the patient’s quality of life significantly.Counselors need to fulfill various rolesA counselor will often take on various roles that far exceed traditional therapy and that may include, but isn’t limited to vocational training, transport, case management, and assistance with the acquisition of student loans. As difficult as it maybe it is important for a counselor to remain actively involved and focused on finding solutions to the concerns of the patient. Apart from offering guidance, a counselor can further enhance healing by helping a patient identify their own strengths and helping them build on it. Expanding on someone’s strengths is not only an effective way of providing much-needed hope but improve overall well-being as well.​Being a counselor is not an easy task by anyone’s standards. By making the effort to understanding the effects of poverty better it will, however, become increasingly easier to assist those who need it the most.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Although counselors typically receive training on cultural diversit",
            "y, this basic consciousness does not necessarily result in a proper understanding of what it entails to live in severe poverty. Despite being typically constructive, most training courses for counselors do not cover the important socioeconomic barriers that are prevalent across the world. Due to this, the average counselor often does not possess the necessary know-how when comes to dealing with patients living in poverty. It is imperative that counselors not only understand the impact poverty ha",

Common concerns stemming from poverty include mental illness, substance abuse, and chronic illness. An individual living below the bread line may, for example, have contracted asthma due to livin",

As a counselor, it is important to not only address the emotional trauma experienced by the patient, but also the individual's physical living situation itself. If the room is filled with bacteria or mold, it is critical to consider how the patient can get their asthma treated and rid the room of the dampness that caused the respiratory distress.The importance of meeting basic needsWhen a person has to constantly worry about where their next meal is going to come from,",
            " it becomes increasingly difficult for them to make themselves emotionally available or counseling. Before traditional counseling can commence it is important that a patient’s basic needs are met. A lot of people living in poverty are of the belief that they are being let down by current systems that do not make provision for their basic needs. It is important that counselors are not only sensitive to these needs but try to help meet them as well. Many impoverished individuals live in absolutely",

While counselors may not have the means to improve the living conditions of a patient themselves, they can help facilitate the necessary assistance to improve the patient’s quality of life significantly.Counselors need to fulfill various rolesA counselor will often take on various roles that far exceed traditional therapy and that may include, but isn’t limited to vocational training, transport, case management, ",

As difficult as it maybe it is important for a counselor to remain actively involved and focused on finding solutions to the concerns of the patient.

As you dedicate yourself to caring for a loved one, it's equally important to prioritize your health and well-being.This guide, courtesy of Jane McGill Counseling, outlines six essential self-care strategies tailored explicitly for new caregivers. These tactics focus on balancing the demands of caregiving with personal health, particularly when navigating the complexities of substance abuse issues.Establish Clear BoundariesOne of the most crucial steps in self-care is establishing clear boundaries. It's important to recognize and respect your physical and emotional limits. Communicating these boundaries to those you care for, as well as other caregivers, is vital.This practice helps prevent caregiver burnout and ensures you maintain a healthy balance between caregiving and your personal life. Setting these boundaries not only safeguards your well-being but also enhances the quality of care you provide, as it allows you to be more present and attentive when you are with your loved one.Embrace Short BreaksTaking short breaks is essential in the demanding role of a caregiver.

Grief affects everyone, but an estimate of 10-20% of individuals who recently suffered a loss develop symptoms of complicated grief, or a mental disorder brought about by bereavement. Because of the high occurrence of grief, professionals can benefit from being equipped with strategies for bereavement counseling using the familiar techniques of team-building and effective goal setting exercises to improve everyday life.  Know the seven stages of griefIn the 1950s, psychiatrist Elizabeth Kübler-Ross developed the effective model of the 5 stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, and acceptance. Recent experts, however, have formed the 7-stage model for grief by adding to final stages: acceptance and hope. It’s important to stress that these stages, while in numerical order, do not represent a linear progression: individuals can cycle through a range of stages before reaching a level of “acceptance” with their loss. It is recommended that counselors and employers periodically “check in” with the grieving individual to assess where they are in their grieving process.Promote healthy team buildingThe phrase 'it takes a village' has a unique and critical meaning when it comes to coping with grief. Recent research suggests that people suffering from symptoms of bereavement highly benefit from community-based counseling, and this makes sense: we tend to rely on large groups of people during times of loss. For the workplace, promoting healthy team-building strategies is an effective technique to cope with individual grieving employees. Employers and professionals should also be aware of the varied symptoms of grief--including anxiety, skin problems, increased heart rate, and other physiological changes.Approach growth in small steps​Finally, a key aspect of bereavement is to employ goal setting strategies to break down larger, overarching goals into smaller, more manageable ones.  Counsel the individual experiencing bereavement to approach tasks in smaller steps and create doable goals for themselves so that they begin to readjust to everyday life. Part of goal-setting is to create a timeline for the target outcome (e.g., in 3 weeks I will sleep in my own bed) while listing strategies that detail how the individual can reach their goal.  With this framework, individuals experiencing acute symptoms of grief can begin to resume their ordinary life.Ultimately, it will take time for individuals to heal and resume productivity after grieving.  Effective bereavement counseling can help individuals work through their complex emotions of grief by offering them a community of support and strategies to cope with their loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Moving forward from the loss that you have experienced may seem impossible, but there are steps you can take to keep yourself going and experience joy again. Consider this list of suggestions from Basic Counseling Skills to help you cope in times of grief. 1. Avoid IsolationWhen experiencing the loss of someone or something important to you, it’s easy to give in to the desire to isolate and grieve in private. While having time to yourself to process isn't a bad thing, it’s also necessary to sustain relationships with others and allow them to be a support system for you. According to Tulane University’s School of Public Health, social isolation can have dramatic effects on not only mental health but physical health as well, with evidence suggesting that isolation is linked with increased risks of heart disease, stroke, and premature mortality.  For people who work from home, it can be especially challenging to avoid isolation during a time of grief. Be sure to make regular efforts to see people every day and to work only during regular designated hours so that you can connect with colleagues, even if it is virtually. 2. Keep a JournalKeeping a journal is often associated with childhood, but journaling’s value extends far beyond adolescence. It offers many benefits, particularly for those struggling with grief-related depression and stress. These include reducing symptoms of depression and other post-trauma issues, enhancing a sense of well-being, and improving working memory. 3. Try Forest BathingWhen death intrudes on our lives, it can be helpful to be reminded of all the natural life around us. Forest bathing or shinrin-yoku is the Japanese practice of using the forest or outdoors to reap the benefits of nature to improve one's mental state and physical health. While simply being away from screens and not sitting all day offers significant benefits, there are others unique to being outdoors, including exposure to phytoncide, a substance emitted by plants and trees. Breathing in air full of this natural oil increases the number of NK or natural killer cells in the body which can help fight infections and cancers. Phytoncides also have been shown to provide a boost in mood, improve attention, encourage creativity and improve sleep. 4. Explore New InterestsFamiliar hobbies can offer comfort in times of grieving, but they can also be reminders of what we have lost. Engaging in a new activity can offer relief and a sense of purpose that is crucial to a healthy mindset. It can also allow you to rediscover parts of yourself that you may have been neglecting or interests that you've put off exploring. Artistic endeavors such as taking a painting class or learning a new instrument can be very beneficial as they allow you to become invested in the creative process. Activities that address your physical health such as taking up running or enrolling in a dance class can be helpful as well, as physical activity has been shown to reduce stress and increase energy and optimism. You can even consider a change of career! Applying for a job can seem intimidating at first but there are tools that can give you an edge over the competition, like this free resume builder. Don't let grief get the best of you. Use the perspective of this time to cultivate a life you can be proud of and happy in once again. Basic Counseling Skills is geared to the needs of University and College Students, Health Care Practitioners, Volunteers, and New Counselors. But my hope is that EVERYONE – including Teachers and Professors, Department Managers, Volunteer Coordinators, and experienced Counselors - will find this a good refresher and will recommend it to others.

Moving forward from the loss that you have experienced may seem impossible, but there are steps you can take to ",
            "keep yourself going and experience joy again. Consider this list of suggestions from Basic Counseling Skills to help you cope in times of grief. 1. Avoid IsolationWhen experiencing the loss of someone or something important to you, it’s easy to give in to the desire to isolate and grieve in private. While having time to yourself to process isn't a bad thing, it’s also necessary to sustain relationships with others and allow them to be a support system for you. According to Tulane University’s Sc",
            "hool of Public Health, social isolation can have dramatic effects on not only mental health but physical health as well, with evidence suggesting that isolation is linked with increased risks of heart disease, stroke, and premature mortality.  For people who work from home, it can be especially challenging to avoid isolation during a time of grief. Be sure to make regular efforts to see people every day and to work only during regular designated hours so that you can connect with colleagues, eve",
            "n if it is virtually. 2. Keep a JournalKeeping a journal is often associated with childhood, but journaling’s value extends far beyond adolescence. It offers many benefits, particularly for those struggling with grief-related depression and stress. These include reducing symptoms of depression and other post-trauma issues, enhancing a sense of well-being, and improving working memory. 3. Try Forest BathingWhen death intrudes on our lives, it can be helpful to be reminded of all the natural life ",
            "around us. Forest bathing or shinrin-yoku is the Japanese practice of using the forest or outdoors to reap the benefits of nature to improve one's mental state and physical health. While simply being away from screens and not sitting all day offers significant benefits, there are others unique to being outdoors, including exposure to phytoncide, a substance emitted by plants and trees. Breathing in air full of this natural oil increases the number of NK or natural killer cells in the body which ",
            "can help fight infections and cancers. Phytoncides also have been shown to provide a boost in mood, improve attention, encourage creativity and improve sleep. 4. Explore New InterestsFamiliar hobbies can offer comfort in times of grieving, but they can also be reminders of what we have lost. Engaging in a new activity can offer relief and a sense of purpose that is crucial to a healthy mindset. It can also allow you to rediscover parts of yourself that you may have been neglecting or interests t",
            "hat you've put off exploring. Artistic endeavors such as taking a painting class or learning a new instrument can be very beneficial as they allow you to become invested in the creative process. Activities that address your physical health such as taking up running or enrolling in a dance class can be helpful as well, as physical activity has been shown to reduce stress and increase energy and optimism. You can even consider a change of career! Applying for a job can seem intimidating at first b",

Near the Start of the Session...*****Mary: “Well Dr. Joan, I’m here for my wellness check in. No touchy, right?!”Joan: “No touchy! I promise! I explained to you the last time that I like to do holistic health counseling or a biopsychosocial inventory – 'though normally I do this earlier in the sessions.”Mary: “But I canceled.”Joan: (Grins) “Actually, you “no-showed” first and then canceled. But that was ‘in the past.’(Another grin.) For personal well being – the biopsycho part – there are six components – physical, social, emotional, spiritual, vocational and intellectual health.  We’ll start with that. Ready!?”Mary: “Ready.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Health\n Joan: “Physical health is comprised of  i) nutrition, ii) ‘anti-nutrition’, iii) sleep, iv) exercise, and v) a medical check up. So, nutrition. If the National Food Guide recommendations are a ‘ten out of ten’ – where do you rate?”Mary: “Probably about a ‘seven.’ I eat well enough, but sometimes I skip meals and I like my junk food.”Joan: “Describe what you ate yesterday.”Mary: “Hmm. Well I slept in and missed breakfast…”Joan: “Not good to miss breakfast. Eating breakfast stimulates your metabolism.”Mary: “So I ate lunch at 11 am – veggie pizza and coke and two cookies.”Joan:  “Glad about the pizza for the calcium and grain group – but it doesn’t  count on the veggie group. By the way, cola has 12 teaspoons of sugar  and cookies have no nutritional value at all.”Mary: “You must be  fun at a party. I had a banana in the afternoon and a carton of milk.  And Andy made an amazing supper – veggie stir fry with lean chicken and  whole grain rice.”Joan: “Awesome – veggies and fruits are the  most important part of our diet – followed by whole grains – followed by  protein foods including calcium sources.”Mary: “And then I ate a bag of chips with another coke in the evening.”Joan: “You know, it wouldn’t be hard at all for you to have scored a perfect ten yesterday. For example:Breakfast – milk, banana, whole wheat toast, and peanut butterLunch – veggie pizza, salad, apple and a diet cokeSupper – double servicing of stir fried veggies, whole grain rice, chicken, Snack  – trail mix or popcorn  and a soda water– but make sure to brush your  teeth! Oh yeah, and a good multivitamin wouldn’t hurt either.”Mary – “Next!”\nJoan: “Anti-nutrition. That’s alcohol, junk food, caffeine, illegal drugs, and nicotine consumption.”Mary:   “I only drink on weekends and not much because I fall asleep. I love  my  chips – have some almost every day – very hard for me to stop even   though I need to – have way too much caffeine – two cokes and two   coffees a day minimum – don’t do drugs and I don’t smoke.”Joan:   “Good about the alcohol. The chips – you could substitute dry popcorn   for with some seasoned salt - if you want to stop. The caffeine is a no   brainer – have one of those pops as caffeine free and sugar free – the   same with one of those coffees.”Mary: “Next. By the way - this is boring.”Joan: “By the way – people who do this feel so much better and you wanted to do this.”Mary: “True enough.”Joan: “I forgot about the water – one to two litres a day.”Mary: “I’ll never get out of the bathroom!”Joan: “This from the girl who drinks two cokes and two large coffees a day! Sleep – any trouble there?”Mary: “Not really. I have a hard time making myself go to bed and then it’s hard to get up in the morning…”Joan:   “Best to stay as close to the rhythm of the sun as possible. Folks who   work nights have a higher than average suicide rate.” Mary: “You really are a bundle of joy aren’t you. Now you are going to ask me about exercise and I’m going to tell you I don’t have time to go to the gym.”Joan:   “Actually, I’m only looking for ½ hour of fast walking every day –   preferably an hour. How far to walk from your apartment to the downtown   bus station – instead of catching the bus?”Mary: “Twenty minutes.”Joan:   “So you do that there and back and add a twenty minute walk with your   sweetheart right after supper – and you’ve got your hour.”Mary: “I’ve been to see the nurse practitioner for a medical check-up.”Joan: “And…”Mary:   “You’re going to love this. She said I have higher than average blood   pressure and cholesterol, and lower than average hemoglobin. And I’m 20   pounds overweight. She said I could fix this by eating more veggies  and  fruits, whole grains and lean meat and low-fat dairy; that I should  cut  back on the coffee and coke and drink more water; get more  exercise; and  take a vitamin with extra iron.”Joan: “I’m not sayin’ a thing! We’ve covered physical health – let’s look at social health.”   Holistic health counseling (biopsychosocial model) is time consuming   but well worth it. You pick up things you might otherwise have missed.   For example, poor emotional health can show up in physical health, and   so on. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Health \nJoan: “ Social health is that component that looks at relationships with i) partner, ii) friends, iii) parents or guardians, and iv) children or dependents.  Do you have any friends?”Mary: “That’s pretty harsh.”Joan:  “I mean, do you have folks you can call – other than your partner – to  go for a decaf sugar-free coffee with? Who you can call and just blather  to when you need to – and they, you?”Mary: “Sarah, just Sarah.”Joan:  “One good friend – in addition to your partner – is all you need. It’s  just that it is too hard on partners to have to be everything.”Mary: “Yeah, I found that out, didn’t I!?”Joan: “We’ve talked about your relationship with your partner  Andy and that is going better now that you’re not leaning as heavily on  him and you’re going to bed at the same time, so you see more of him.  How about your parents?”Mary: “Things have always been OK  with Dad pretty much because he’s not in my face. And mom, I actually  got up the courage to tell her that – since I’m so stressed with essays –  would it be OK with her if I she only called once a week. Sunday  evenings were good.”Joan: “And???”Mary: “She wasn’t very  happy and continued to call. But we have ‘ident-i-call’ so now I’m trying  to only answer on Sunday evening. If she ever says anything, I’ll tell  her I was at the library.”Joan: “No kids or siblings.”Mary: “Those are relationships I don’t have to worry about. At least not yet.”Joan: “On to emotional health.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmotional \nJoan: “Emotional health includes i) being nice to yourself, ii)  hobbies, and iii) a good sense of humor.  Do you do nice things for yourself?”Mary: “Like I can afford to!”Joan:  “It doesn’t have to be expensive. It can be a bubble bath with a good  book, an old movie, a really good cup of coffee (oops!), or going for a  long walk.”Mary: “What’s this got to do with anything?”Joan:  “Doing something nice for yourself is your way of saying ‘I’m OK! I  matter! I count for something! I’m worth it!’ You and me – we cannot  depend on others to make us happy. We have to do this for ourselves.”Mary:  “Funny you should mention this. I buy plants on sale, I adopt plants. I  plain love rehabilitating other people’s plants. If there is such thing  as a plant-a-holic, I am one!”Joan: “Good! I think… It makes you happy and you aren’t doing it for anyone but yourself (and it doesn’t hurt anybody)?”Mary: “Yep!”Joan: “Fab! Do you have any hobbies?”Mary:  “Anything green. Seriously, I am a ‘guerilla gardener’. I grow stuff  all winter when no one else can and in the spring – you cannot imagine  what I grow on my balcony. Plus, I steal garden space in an abandoned  warehouse lot and grow a vegetable garden.”Joan: “Really! I can barely grow mould!”Mary: “Actually, and this is really neat, I rescue perennials from abandoned gardens and decorate rooming houses.”Joan: “You’re having me on!”Mary:  “It gets worse, or better, depending how you look at it. I’m part of a  local chapter of Guerilla Gardeners. Our motto is ‘Let's fight the filth  with forks and flowers.”Joan: “Any problems with police?”Mary: “Are you kidding? They love us. Make something lovable and guess what, the surroundings become more lovable.”Joan: “I should know that, shouldn’t I?! How neat! And I need to get the contact info for other students. How about laughter? Do you ever have a good laugh? You know, watch a funny movie, get silly, that sort of thing?”Mary:  “Not enough. But I’ve discovered old movies. Ones like ‘Harvey’ and  ‘Arsenic and Old Lace’. I can borrow them from the library for free.  They are a scream. It’s my Saturday night special – if I can stay  awake.” \n\n\n\nSpiritual \nJoan: “The next ‘block’ is Spiritual health. It’s a couple of things – i)  having  appreciation and gratitude that we are part of a larger whole,  ii) knowing our purpose in life, iii) it can be religious practice, and  iv) volunteering for a good cause .”Mary: “I bet you think I’m an atheist or an agnostic.”Joan: “Maybe…”Mary: “I’m a card-carrying Roman Catholic. I’m not sure why – other than that was how I was raised. But it ‘took’.”Joan: “Many people find that religious practice, that caring for their roots is very satisfying – if you’ll pardon the gardening pun.”Mary:  “That is certainly true for me. Andy doesn’t get it – but he’s the  first to say that I have a somewhat other-worldly global perspective on  things. I’m so grateful to be alive.”Joan: “As part of the ‘Spirituality’ thing, I normally mention volunteering – but it sounds like you’re already doing that.”Mary:  “Absolutely. And I am particularly interested in Korean gardening –  it’s very spiritual you know. I’m doing a major paper on that right  now.”Joan: “OK, I’m absolutely amazed! Hmm we just have a few minutes. Intellectual health I’m not concerned about with you – you are in university, writing essays. And vocational, how about we leave that to next time.Mary:  Actually, that’s a huge one for me. It’s worth a whole session. Not  only do I not know what I’m going to do when I graduate, I don’t have a sense of purpose. I don’t mean that I want to be a nun. It’s just that nothing has grabbed me yet.”Session Six on Holistic Health Counseling / Inventory (Biopsychosocial Model)winds down… \n\n\n\nHealth is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. - World Health Organization, 1948\n\n\n\n\nBuy  at AllPosters.com\n\n\n\n\ntake me to the top of this page!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Ready!?”Mary: “Ready.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Health\n Joan: “Physical health is comprised of  i) nutrition, ii) ‘anti-nutrition’, iii) sleep, iv) exercise, and v) a medical check up. So, nutrition. If the National Food Guide recommendations are a ‘ten out of ten’ – where do you rate?”Mary: “Probably about a ‘seven.’ I eat well enough, but sometimes I skip meals and I like my junk food.”Joan: “Describe what you ate yesterda",
            "y.”Mary: “Hmm. Well I slept in and missed breakfast…”Joan: “Not good to miss breakfast. Eating breakfast stimulates your metabolism.”Mary: “So I ate lunch at 11 am – veggie pizza and coke and two cookies.”Joan:  “Glad about the pizza for the calcium and grain group – but it doesn’t  count on the veggie group. By the way, cola has 12 teaspoons of sugar  and cookies have no nutritional value at all.”Mary: “You must be  fun at a party. I had a banana in the afternoon and a carton of milk.  And Andy",
            " made an amazing supper – veggie stir fry with lean chicken and  whole grain rice.”Joan: “Awesome – veggies and fruits are the  most important part of our diet – followed by whole grains – followed by  protein foods including calcium sources.”Mary: “And then I ate a bag of chips with another coke in the evening.”Joan: “You know, it wouldn’t be hard at all for you to have scored a perfect ten yesterday. For example:Breakfast – milk, banana, whole wheat toast, and peanut butterLunch – veggie pizza",
            ", salad, apple and a diet cokeSupper – double servicing of stir fried veggies, whole grain rice, chicken, Snack  – trail mix or popcorn  and a soda water– but make sure to brush your  teeth! Oh yeah, and a good multivitamin wouldn’t hurt either.”Mary – “Next!”\nJoan: “Anti-nutrition. That’s alcohol, junk food, caffeine, illegal drugs, and nicotine consumption.”Mary:   “I only drink on weekends and not much because I fall asleep. I love  my  chips – have some almost every day – very hard for me to",
            " stop even   though I need to – have way too much caffeine – two cokes and two   coffees a day minimum – don’t do drugs and I don’t smoke.”Joan:   “Good about the alcohol. The chips – you could substitute dry popcorn   for with some seasoned salt - if you want to stop. The caffeine is a no   brainer – have one of those pops as caffeine free and sugar free – the   same with one of those coffees.”Mary: “Next. By the way - this is boring.”Joan: “By the way – people who do this feel so much better a",
            "nd you wanted to do this.”Mary: “True enough.”Joan: “I forgot about the water – one to two litres a day.”Mary: “I’ll never get out of the bathroom!”Joan: “This from the girl who drinks two cokes and two large coffees a day! Sleep – any trouble there?”Mary: “Not really. I have a hard time making myself go to bed and then it’s hard to get up in the morning…”Joan:   “Best to stay as close to the rhythm of the sun as possible. Folks who   work nights have a higher than average suicide rate.” Mary: “",
            "You really are a bundle of joy aren’t you. Now you are going to ask me about exercise and I’m going to tell you I don’t have time to go to the gym.”Joan:   “Actually, I’m only looking for ½ hour of fast walking every day –   preferably an hour. How far to walk from your apartment to the downtown   bus station – instead of catching the bus?”Mary: “Twenty minutes.”Joan:   “So you do that there and back and add a twenty minute walk with your   sweetheart right after supper – and you’ve got your hou",
            "r.”Mary: “I’ve been to see the nurse practitioner for a medical check-up.”Joan: “And…”Mary:   “You’re going to love this. She said I have higher than average blood   pressure and cholesterol, and lower than average hemoglobin. And I’m 20   pounds overweight. She said I could fix this by eating more veggies  and  fruits, whole grains and lean meat and low-fat dairy; that I should  cut  back on the coffee and coke and drink more water; get more  exercise; and  take a vitamin with extra iron.”Joan:",
            " “I’m not sayin’ a thing! We’ve covered physical health – let’s look at social health.”   Holistic health counseling (biopsychosocial model) is time consuming   but well worth it. You pick up things you might otherwise have missed.   For example, poor emotional health can show up in physical health, and   so on. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Health \nJoan: “ Social health is that component that looks at relationships with i) partner, ii) friends, iii) parents or guardians, and iv) children or dependents.  Do y",
            "ou have any friends?”Mary: “That’s pretty harsh.”Joan:  “I mean, do you have folks you can call – other than your partner – to  go for a decaf sugar-free coffee with? Who you can call and just blather  to when you need to – and they, you?”Mary: “Sarah, just Sarah.”Joan:  “One good friend – in addition to your partner – is all you need. It’s  just that it is too hard on partners to have to be everything.”Mary: “Yeah, I found that out, didn’t I!?”Joan: “We’ve talked about your relationship with yo",
            "ur partner  Andy and that is going better now that you’re not leaning as heavily on  him and you’re going to bed at the same time, so you see more of him.  How about your parents?”Mary: “Things have always been OK  with Dad pretty much because he’s not in my face. And mom, I actually  got up the courage to tell her that – since I’m so stressed with essays –  would it be OK with her if I she only called once a week. Sunday  evenings were good.”Joan: “And???”Mary: “She wasn’t very  happy and conti",
            "nued to call. But we have ‘ident-i-call’ so now I’m trying  to only answer on Sunday evening. If she ever says anything, I’ll tell  her I was at the library.”Joan: “No kids or siblings.”Mary: “Those are relationships I don’t have to worry about. At least not yet.”Joan: “On to emotional health.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmotional \nJoan: “Emotional health includes i) being nice to yourself, ii)  hobbies, and iii) a good sense of humor.  Do you do nice things for yourself?”Mary: “Like I can afford to!”Joan:  “It d",
            "oesn’t have to be expensive. It can be a bubble bath with a good  book, an old movie, a really good cup of coffee (oops!), or going for a  long walk.”Mary: “What’s this got to do with anything?”Joan:  “Doing something nice for yourself is your way of saying ‘I’m OK! I  matter! I count for something! I’m worth it!’ You and me – we cannot  depend on others to make us happy. We have to do this for ourselves.”Mary:  “Funny you should mention this. I buy plants on sale, I adopt plants. I  plain love ",
            "rehabilitating other people’s plants. If there is such thing  as a plant-a-holic, I am one!”Joan: “Good! I think… It makes you happy and you aren’t doing it for anyone but yourself (and it doesn’t hurt anybody)?”Mary: “Yep!”Joan: “Fab! Do you have any hobbies?”Mary:  “Anything green. Seriously, I am a ‘guerilla gardener’. I grow stuff  all winter when no one else can and in the spring – you cannot imagine  what I grow on my balcony. Plus, I steal garden space in an abandoned  warehouse lot and g",
            "row a vegetable garden.”Joan: “Really! I can barely grow mould!”Mary: “Actually, and this is really neat, I rescue perennials from abandoned gardens and decorate rooming houses.”Joan: “You’re having me on!”Mary:  “It gets worse, or better, depending how you look at it. I’m part of a  local chapter of Guerilla Gardeners. Our motto is ‘Let's fight the filth  with forks and flowers.”Joan: “Any problems with police?”Mary: “Are you kidding? They love us. Make something lovable and guess what, the sur",
            "roundings become more lovable.”Joan: “I should know that, shouldn’t I?! How neat! And I need to get the contact info for other students. How about laughter? Do you ever have a good laugh? You know, watch a funny movie, get silly, that sort of thing?”Mary:  “Not enough. But I’ve discovered old movies. Ones like ‘Harvey’ and  ‘Arsenic and Old Lace’. I can borrow them from the library for free.  They are a scream. It’s my Saturday night special – if I can stay  awake.” \n\n\n\nSpiritual \nJoan: “The nex",
            "t ‘block’ is Spiritual health. It’s a couple of things – i)  having  appreciation and gratitude that we are part of a larger whole,  ii) knowing our purpose in life, iii) it can be religious practice, and  iv) volunteering for a good cause .”Mary: “I bet you think I’m an atheist or an agnostic.”Joan: “Maybe…”Mary: “I’m a card-carrying Roman Catholic. I’m not sure why – other than that was how I was raised. But it ‘took’.”Joan: “Many people find that religious practice, that caring for their root",
            "s is very satisfying – if you’ll pardon the gardening pun.”Mary:  “That is certainly true for me. Andy doesn’t get it – but he’s the  first to say that I have a somewhat other-worldly global perspective on  things. I’m so grateful to be alive.”Joan: “As part of the ‘Spirituality’ thing, I normally mention volunteering – but it sounds like you’re already doing that.”Mary:  “Absolutely. And I am particularly interested in Korean gardening –  it’s very spiritual you know. I’m doing a major paper on",
            " that right  now.”Joan: “OK, I’m absolutely amazed! Hmm we just have a few minutes. Intellectual health I’m not concerned about with you – you are in university, writing essays. And vocational, how about we leave that to next time.Mary:  Actually, that’s a huge one for me. It’s worth a whole session. Not  only do I not know what I’m going to do when I graduate, I don’t have a sense of purpose. I don’t mean that I want to be a nun. It’s just that nothing has grabbed me yet.”Session Six on Holisti",

Others, however, dread those long, hot boring days with nothing to do and no income rolling in. While summer can be a great time to take a vacation or get involved in your church or community, it can also be a time of high anxiety, especially for those who need to bring in extra income over those months.Educators have a wealth of knowledge and experience that is highly sought after in many part-time or freelance positions. Since so many of these side gigs provide the freedom and flexibility of working from home or setting your own hours, teachers can really use these experiences to pad their incomes. Because these positions are so malleable, many teachers find they can keep these side gigs going year-round.Ideas Make MoneyStarting your own business may seem intimidating at first, but it can be quite simple to do and quite profitable in the long term. You can use the downtime of the summer to kick your startup into gear. You’ll want to begin with a niche idea, one that incorporates what you know and what you’re good at, like starting a kids or family fitness class or clean and organize homes with messy kids. You can also take advantage of popular trends in business ideas, such as decorative cell phone cases, wireless earbuds or organic tea.  Experience Gets SalesYour creativity in the classroom is unmatched--and you’ve seen it work firsthand with students. Why not share that wisdom and experience with others? There are several ways you can make extra cash by using what you already have and know. Over the summer, build a website (it’s easier than you think) that allows people to purchase and download your lesson plans, classroom activities and test prep projects. If you have a special skill set, such as using music to teach history or helping kids with disabilities with reading comprehension, you can create an online course that people pay to take on learning platforms like Udemy.Educators Offer ExpertiseAs a teacher, you have specialized experience and knowledge with what students need to understand in order to get into college. That’s why testing sites such as ACT like to hire educators to help with writing questions and answers and assisting with quality assurance. No one knows if the test questions really reflect classroom education like a teacher does. There are other organizations including eNotes that hire teachers to work from home to help kids with homework. Another side gig that can turn into year-round income is online tutoring. Tutors in the STEM field (science, technology, engineering and math) are always in high demand. However, there is a need for the arts and humanities, as well. Armed with a computer and an Internet connection you can teach English to second-language learners. Homes and Cars Can Bring in a BuckIf you don’t want your side gig to be an extension of your professional life, you can always try your hand at ridesharing, home rentals or food delivery. A summer sig gig driving for Uber or Lyft can turn into a weekend job year-round. You can add to that income by delivering food to customers who use UberEats or GrubHub. If you have an extra bedroom and enjoy meeting new people, list your space for rent on Airbnb. These ideas all allow you to decide when and where you work.Whether you need to supplement your income or you just enjoy staying busy, summer side gigs can really make an impact on your bank account. From paying off a car to saving for a vacation, year-round side gigs not only fit into your schedule, but they fit into your lifestyle.- Joyce Wilson[email protected]  Teacherspark.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Pixabay - https://pixabay.com/en/office-tax-business-finance-620822/side gigs - https://www.weareteachers.com/ways-teachers-can-make-extra-money/kick your startup - https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/249674popular trends - https://www.oberlo.com/blog/business-ideas-that-make-moneyit's easier than you think - https://www.websitebuilderexpert.com/how-to-build-a-website/lesson plans - http://www.businessinsider.com/teachers-making-millions-online-lesson-plans-2017-4Udemy - https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/229605508-Getting-Started-How-do-I-Create-my-Udemy-Course-ACT - https://www.act.org/content/act/en/working-at-act.htmlteach English - https://t.vipkid.com.cn/?refereeId=6586149&transactionId=102654087c5fd9453c5604bb1044ff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Since so many of these side gigs provide the freedom and flexibility of working from home or setting your own hours, teachers can really use these experiences to pad their",

That’s why testing sites such as A",
            "CT like to hire educators to help with writing questions and answers and assisting with quality assurance. No one knows if the test questions really reflect classroom education like a teacher does. There are other organizations including eNotes that hire teachers to work from home to help kids with homework. Another side gig that can turn into year-round income is online tutoring. Tutors in the STEM field (science, technology, engineering and math) are always in high demand. However, there is a ",
            "need for the arts and humanities, as well. Armed with a computer and an Internet connection you can teach English to second-language learners. Homes and Cars Can Bring in a BuckIf you don’t want your side gig to be an extension of your professional life, you can always try your hand at ridesharing, home rentals or food delivery. A summer sig gig driving for Uber or Lyft can turn into a weekend job year-round. You can add to that income by delivering food to customers who use UberEats or GrubHub.",

These ideas all allow you to decide when and where you work.Whether you need to supplement your income or you just enjoy staying busy, summer side gigs can really make an impact on your bank account.

It extends the length of the session and  increases progress. Clients who come to see me get assigned  out-of-session work every week. I do this for a variety of reasons:1.\tTo reinforce that positive change is hard work. What we are NOT having is simply a gab session.2.\tTo help clients become more self aware. 3.\tTo decrease the amount I talk. Things I would like to say, I provide in written format.4.\tTo educate them, to provide them with tools for themselves and others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat follows is a list of Homework Possibilities and Readings.

While it's common to feel that things won’t change regardless of what you do, by making small but consistent changes things can turn around. This article by Basic Counseling Skills takes you through three simple changes to make to your routine starting today, which will lead to you feeling happier and improve your wellbeing. Stop Being Negative Do you feel like bad things always happen to you? Or does even the slightest of inconveniences lead to a flood of negative thoughts? Sounds like you have a habit of negative thinking. Having such thoughts constantly can impact your mental health, reduce motivation and productivity at work. Having negative thoughts is normal, however, it’s important to put things in perspective and work towards overcoming them. Here are a few ways to do just that:Start your day with a positive thought. This can be something as simple as – today will be a great day. It’s okay even if you don’t believe it, the aim is to condition yourself to begin the day on a good note.Encourage yourself to focus on the positive side of things. This reduces stress and helps gain clarity of thought while handling stressful situations.Avoid dwelling on the past. Understandably, certain instances will have an impact on you, but it’s important to work towards accepting them rather than thinking about the what-ifs. You cannot change the past; however, you are in control of your present.Facing your fears will help overcome uncertainties leading to stress. Whether it’s switching jobs or meeting new people, gather the courage to face it and you are sure to feel better once it is over. In fact, if a new job is in order, having your resume professionally updated makes it easier to take the leap.   As reported by HealthyPlace, an effective way to focus on the positive is to write it down. Each night list down five positive things about your day or something you are grateful for. These can be small things such as having a good lunch or meeting your deadlines. When you are facing negative thoughts, reading your journal can help you gain perspective and feel better. Stop Restricting Yourself Restricting yourself from doing things you may want to do based on other people’s opinions will make you feel unhappy and stressed. This could be exercising in public, starting a business, or even being friends with someone. It’s better to try new things than be in the same rut that makes you stressed. Make a list of all the things you want to try or explore, such as starting a gym routine or launching your business. If you haven’t tried it before, counseling can be a very therapeutic method of working through emotional issues, and it can help you create a toolkit to navigate mental health disorders like anxiety or depression. Stop Living Your Life Indoors According to research, most Canadians spend 90% of their time indoors. This staggering statistic should make you rethink how you spend your time. Being indoors equates to spending more time in front of screens, whether it is your mobile, laptop, or television. Blue light emitted from these screens results in eye strain, headaches, and problems with your sleep cycle. Make it a point to spend at least 10-30 minutes outdoors daily. This can include a walk in your neighborhood, visiting the local park, or practicing gardening. Additionally, you can plan periodic outdoor trips such as trekking, rafting, mountain climbing, and more. In addition to a much-needed change in scenery, going outdoors provides you the following benefits:Decrease in heart rate leading to a reduction in mental and physical stressImproved cardiovascular healthIncrease in cortisol levels making you feel happierBoost in creativity and mindfulnessImproved immune response due to increase in Vitamin D levels from being in sunlight   By consistently practicing these three steps you will realize a positive change in your well-being.

When you are facing negative thoughts, reading your journal can help you ",

This could be exercising in public, starting a business, or even being friends with someone. It’s better to try new things than be in the same rut that makes you stressed. Make a list of all the things you want to try or explore, such as starting a gym routine or launching your business. If you haven’t trie",

(Link is to Person-centred counselling: an experiential approach  by David L. Rennie.) We all have our favorite stance, our “default  position.” At the same time, communication is 55% body language, 38%  tone and 7% words. So, remember that your client may not remember what  was said, but they will remember how you made them feel.    I like the SOLERF method\n\n\n\n\n\nS - Squarely face person vs. sitting kitty-corner.O - use Open posture vs. crossed arms and legsL - Lean a little toward the person vs. settling back in your chairE - use Eye contact vs. staring off into deep spaceR - Relax, keep it natural vs. sitting like a boardF – look friendly vs. neutral or scowlingTake a look at how you are sitting right now. Hmm … arms crossed?  Slumped?  Bored expression? Looking offside?  Not good.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Class Homework - Encouraging / Discouraging Body Language Exercise: 10 minutes of different styles of body \"speech\" and 5 minutes of feedbackSpeaker - Talk to the listener about an interesting incident that happened to you over the past few days.Listener - Systematically go down the SOLERF list, first using the positive BL. And then it’s opposite.  For  example, while the speaker is talking – the listener can lean a little  toward the person – then slump into her/his chair. (Don’t worry if you  both end up laughing.)***** Speaker1. Were you more likely to feel like continuing when you received positive BL?2. How did you feel when the listener used negative?Listener1. Did you notice a change in your interest level when you used positive BL?  2. Did you feel less interested in what the speaker had to say when you assumed negative?Time to switch roles! ***** Out of Class HomeworkBe very conscious of how you treat  people vis-a-vis your body language. Watch the gestures and mannerisms  of others and note how it makes you feel?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI speak two languages, Body and English! - Mae West\n\n\n\n\nBuy  at AllPosters.com\n\n\n\n\ntake me to the top of the page!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Wright, Monica Ramirez Basco, Michael E. Thase.) Understanding it is as simple as A B C.Activating Event – the actual event and the client’s immediate interpretations of the eventBeliefs about the event – this evaluation can be rational or irrationalConsequences – how you feel and what you do or other thoughts \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the charts above and below (from counselingresource.com) you can see  how that when a negative event happens, one can interpret it positively  or negatively.  How one interprets it affects how one feels, thinks and  behaves. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*****“Founder”: Aaron T Beck (1921 - )\"The stronger person is  not the one making the most noise but the one who can quietly direct the  conversation toward defining and solving problems.\" *****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples \n\nSituation One – Negative PerspectiveA - Mary is walking down the street, and her friend Sarah walks right on by.  B – Mary thinks, “Oh Sarah is such a jerk.”C – Next time, Mary ignores Sarah.The “B” may or may not be true. Here is another possibility.Situation Two – Positive Perspective  A - Mary is walking down the street, and her friend Sarah walks right on by.  B – Mary thinks, “Oh that Sarah, always distracted.”C – Mary calls out, Sarah apologizes for missing her, and they go for coffee!As you can see, the role of the counselor in cognitive behavioral therapy is to challenge false beliefs – what I call ...  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lies We Tell Ourselves \nThese distortions in our thinking including: 1.\tBlack-and-White - Thinking or either / or thinking.2.\tMaking Unfair Comparisons  – usually in the negative3.\tFiltering  – honing in on the negative, forgetting the positive.4.\tPersonalizing  - The Self-Blame Game5.\tMind-Reading  – thinking we know what others think (negatively)6.\tCatastrophising  – imagining the worst case scenario7.\tOvergeneralising  – “I always mess up…”8.\tConfusing Fact with Feeling  – “If I think or feel this way then my thoughts/feelings must be correct'.9.\tLabelling  – I’m a loser vs. I made a mistake.10.\t'Can't Standitis'  – being unnecessarily intolerant \n\n\n\nSample Session\nIn Sample Session Five, counselor Joan took a more direct approach  with client Mary. Joan has the luxury of being able to confront Mary –  to \"take the gloves off\" regarding Mary’s treatment of her own self –  and know that if the client doesn’t agree, she can vote with her feet.  Friends and partners can’t do that.Cognitive Behavioral Therapy  or any kind of professional and/or compassionate counseling is not about  pretending problems don't exist. Rather, it’s about being more accurate  about strengths and resources and enlisting these to make the changes  necessary to live a good life on a number of levels. \n\n\n\nFurther Reading and Video\n Books   \"The Cognitive Theory of Depression\" by Aaron T. Beck, Guilford Press, 1979\"The Feeling Good Handbook\" by David D. Burns, Avon Books, 1999Aim  for success, not perfection. Never give up your right to be wrong,  because then you will lose the ability to learn new things and move  forward with your life. Remember that fear always lurks behind  perfectionism. Confronting your fears and allowing yourself the right to  be human can, paradoxically, make yourself a happier and more  productive person. – David BurnsVideo on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqW8p9WPweQ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most striking differences between a cat and a lie [especially the lies we tell ourselves] is that a cat has only nine lives. - Mark Twain\n\n\n\n\nBuy  at AllPosters.com\n\n\n\n\ntake me to the top of this page!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Sometimes, they even make more money than those founded by their more mature counterparts. The appetite of newer generations for entrepreneurship is also enormous. According to a survey from researchers studying youthful business orientation, 60% of teens say they would prefer running their own business rather than working as an employee. From Basic Counseling Skills, here's what adolescents need to know about getting their start as entrepreneurs. Benefits of Teens Starting Businesses There are plenty of good reasons for starting a business early in life. Besides teaching life lessons, it also supports the growth of time-management skills. Further, it helps develop communication abilities, teaches responsibility, and infuses a sense of self-worth into young businesspersons.  Starting a venture on the younger side comes with certain advantages. For one, failing is less likely to be a tragic setback. Since dependents do not have living expenses, they can financially recover without much struggle. Adolescents are also full of energy and highly creative, giving them a distinct advantage over older folks set in their ways.  Ideas for Teens Starting Businesses There are a million ventures appropriate for younger citizens. Pet walking and lawn care businesses are two popular options. Car detailing and housecleaning are good alternatives for teenagers with a natural compulsion for tidying up. Not every venture requires traveling to customers. Many run entirely on video chat software. Instrument lessons and academic tutoring are two examples. Crafty teens can sell handmade items through their websites by using Shopify. Items they should consider selling include greeting cards, custom artwork, and homemade soaps or candles. Making these products doesn't require a factory, nor does inventory take up much space. A relatively clean bedroom is all a blossoming industrialist needs. Settling on a business path can be tricky. The right decision often comes with matching the person's skill set. Another strategy is following one's passion. Parents and teachers can serve a valuable role in helping figure out what direction they should take.  Best Practices for Teens Starting Businesses Getting any venture off the ground starts with a business plan. Having one vastly increases the odds of success, and teen startups are no exception. Comprehensive blueprints describe everything about a company, including the delivery of products and services. They also explain the reasons for chosen business structures, detail financial projections, and explore what funding is necessary. No teen entrepreneur knows how to start a business their first time out, however if they’re ready to start a new company, a guide can be helpful. A good guide will provide a list of all the major steps they’ll need to take to get their business off the ground. They may also find it helpful to work with a formation service to handle the registration paperwork. Teen businesspersons should implement invoicing software. These programs help make sure the books are accurate, in addition to speeding up client payments. The best software solutions let customers pay online and send alerts the instant customers receive and fulfill invoices. Likewise, they offer the ability to schedule recurring payments, thus reducing the possibility of collections falling through the cracks. Finding the first set of customers is often challenging for any startup. Spreading the word is vital. Teenagers are especially adept at social media and getting messages to go viral. Another strategy is to try to find local investors who are willing to help get the business going. On social media, video is king when it comes to driving engagement. If you’re concerned about the size of video files you want to share, you can convert videos to GIFs for free in order to get similar results with smaller files. You can even adjust the aspect ratio, length, and file size to meet your needs. Once you’ve made your edits, you can download your new GIF to use as you like. The world is eagerly awaiting the next wave of teenage entrepreneurs.

By “community resources” I mean those  organizations and activities that are accessible to all, regardless of  financial status, and serve to build community. They can be based on  information, support, activity or specialty.In the Greater City  of Sudbury, which is where I live, here are some examples. You likely  have community resources similar to these in your neck of the woods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LibraryAs well at offering books and films “for free” (publically funded) the library offers film showings, children’s activities, computer use, and seminars on a variety of topics.Lesiure ServicesA variety of activities – physical, artistic, youth centres, and an older adult centre – for free or a nominal fee.Community ResourcesThe comprehensive list of self-help groups and health agencies was composed by our local Canadian Mental Health Association. Every Drop Counts: Tips for Sustainable Water Usehttps://www.comparethemarket.com/home-insurance/content/reducing-water-consumption/Volunteer ServicesNormally, volunteering doesn’t cost a cent – and it’s a gift the gives to the volunteer as well as the clients or patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does it matter? \n\nWhy does it matter that you get involved in the community – either on the giving or receiving end of education and care? Because studies on - and lived experience with - anxiety, depression and stress show that getting involved and trying new things are central to improving all facets of health.As one person put it:You may feel depressed, but it is not your identity.[T]he worst thing you can do is nothing.For even more information, visit www.helpguide.org – a respected non-profit resource. Again, you will need to involve an accountability partner or trusted friend. It’s too easy to give up and stay home. If you cannot easily think of one – and I’m certain you will in time – you can turn to an online support group. I recommend www.dailystrength.org . It is the largest, most comprehensive on-line health network of people sharing their advice, treatment experiences, and support.\n\n\n\n\nBooks and Videos\nBooks\"How to Be an Activist\" - by Elizabeth May, Sierra Club, 1996\"Neighborhood Power: Building Community The Seattle Way\" - by Jim Diers, University of Washington Press, 2004Linkhttps://wavelengths.com/7-key-life-skills-for-people-in-recovery/ - a reader contributionVideoJust when you thought it was safe to go in the wasteland again...It's Guerilla Gardening!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNever doubt that a small, group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world.

(The link is to \"50 self-help classics: 50 inspirational books to transform your life by Tom Butler-Bowdon.)S.H., to my mind, has gotten a bad rap as being akin to selfishness. Me, I favour Abraham Maslow’s understanding of self-help – which is in order to “self-actualize” – to become all we are meant to be – we need to have certain needs met.Thus the understanding of this S.H. section is that when we have achieved some degree of wellness ourselves, we can work with others to help in their healing. In helping ourselves, we help ourselves – provide self-help!The pictoral theme of this section is animals (including human animals) helping each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccountability Partner\n I encourage you to get an  accountability partner (also known as a friend) and do all of these S. H. exercises systematically - one per week. By the end of one week you will have had  the equivalent of nine to ten sessions of counseling.  At a rate of,  let's say, $75 per hour times two people, you've just saved yourselves  $1500.00!I feel very strongly  that any person who embarks on becoming a counselor needs to have  in-depth counseling over a period of time in order to discover and  incorporate her or his dimples and warts. And  I maintain that counselors should see a counselor at least twice a year  - usually more. By doing this they we will not be as tempted to bring  our own problems and resolutions into the counseling appointments of  others.  \nTechniques and Exercises\nHere is a list of S.H. techniques and exercises many have found helpful. I hope you do too.

Simons, Donald B. Irwin and Beverly A. DrinnienMaslow  has set up a hierarchy of five levels of basic needs. Beyond these  needs, higher levels of needs exist. These include needs for  understanding, esthetic appreciation and purely spiritual needs. In the  levels of the five basic needs, the person does not feel the second need  until the demands of the first have been satisfied, nor the third until  the second has been satisfied, and so on. Maslow's basic needs are as  follows: physiological, safety, belongingness, esteem and  self-actualization.  1.\tPhysiological NeedsThese  are biological needs. They consist of needs for oxygen, food, water, and  a relatively constant body temperature. They are the strongest needs  because if a person were deprived of all needs, the physiological ones  would come first in the person's search for satisfaction.2.\tSafety Needs  When all physiological needs are satisfied and are no longer  controlling thoughts and behaviors, the needs for security can become  active. Adults have little awareness of their security needs except in  times of emergency or periods of disorganization in the social structure  (such as widespread rioting). Children often display the signs of  insecurity and the need to be safe.3.\tNeeds of Love, Affection and BelongingnessWhen  the needs for safety and for physiological well-being are satisfied,  the next class of needs for love, affection and belongingness can  emerge. Maslow states that people seek to overcome feelings of  loneliness and alienation. This involves both giving and receiving love,  affection and the sense of belonging.4.\tNeeds for Esteem  When the first three classes of needs are satisfied, the needs for  esteem can become dominant. These involve needs for both self-esteem and  for the esteem a person gets from others. Humans have a need for a  stable, firmly based, high level of self-respect, and respect from  others. When these needs are satisfied, the person feels self-confident  and valuable as a person in the world. When these needs are frustrated,  the person feels inferior, weak, helpless and worthless.5.\tNeeds for Self-ActualizationWhen  all of the foregoing needs are satisfied, then and only then are the  needs for self-actualization activated. Maslow describes  self-actualization as a person's need to be and do that which the person  was \"born to do.\" \"A musician must make music, an artist must paint,  and a poet must write.\" These needs make themselves felt in signs of  restlessness. The person feels on edge, tense, lacking something, in  short, restless. If a person is hungry, unsafe, not loved or accepted,  or lacking self-esteem, it is very easy to know what the person is  restless about. It is not always clear what a person wants when there is  a need for self-actualization. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.\tNeed to Transcend the SelfLater in his life, Maslow  came to decide self-actualization was not the highest level of  development, and proposed that people who have reached  self-actualization will sometimes experience a state he referred to as  \"transcendence,\" in which they become aware of not only their own  fullest potential, but the fullest potential of human beings at large.   \n\n\n\nFurther Reading and Videos\nBooks\"The Third Force: The Psychology of Abraham Maslow\" by Frank G Goble, 2004\"50 Self-Help Classics: 50 Inspirational Books to Transform Your Life, from Timeless Sages to Contemporary Gurus\" by Tom Butler-Bowdon, 2003Video Maslow's Hierarchy by Camille \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of life is not to be happy - but to matter, to be productive, to be useful, to have it make some difference that you have lived at all. - Leo Rosten\n\n\n\n\nBuy  at AllPosters.com\n\n\n\n\ntake me to the top of this page!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Me, I favour Abraham Maslow’s understanding of self-help – which is in order to “self-actualize” – to become all we are meant to be – we need to have certain needs met.Thus the understanding of this S.H. section is that when we have achieved some degree of wellness ourselves, we can work with others to help in their healing.

Simons, Donald B. Irwin and Beverly A. DrinnienMaslow  has set up a hierarchy of five levels of basic needs. Beyond these  needs, higher levels of needs exist. These include needs for  understanding, esthetic appreciation and purely spiritual needs. In the  levels of th",
            "e five basic needs, the person does not feel the second need  until the demands of the first have been satisfied, nor the third until  the second has been satisfied, and so on. Maslow's basic needs are as  follows: physiological, safety, belongingness, esteem and  self-actualization.  1.\tPhysiological NeedsThese  are biological needs. They consist of needs for oxygen, food, water, and  a relatively constant body temperature. They are the strongest needs  because if a person were deprived of all ",
            "needs, the physiological ones  would come first in the person's search for satisfaction.2.\tSafety Needs  When all physiological needs are satisfied and are no longer  controlling thoughts and behaviors, the needs for security can become  active. Adults have little awareness of their security needs except in  times of emergency or periods of disorganization in the social structure  (such as widespread rioting). Children often display the signs of  insecurity and the need to be safe.3.\tNeeds of Lo",
            "ve, Affection and BelongingnessWhen  the needs for safety and for physiological well-being are satisfied,  the next class of needs for love, affection and belongingness can  emerge. Maslow states that people seek to overcome feelings of  loneliness and alienation. This involves both giving and receiving love,  affection and the sense of belonging.4.\tNeeds for Esteem  When the first three classes of needs are satisfied, the needs for  esteem can become dominant. These involve needs for both self-",
            "esteem and  for the esteem a person gets from others. Humans have a need for a  stable, firmly based, high level of self-respect, and respect from  others. When these needs are satisfied, the person feels self-confident  and valuable as a person in the world. When these needs are frustrated,  the person feels inferior, weak, helpless and worthless.5.\tNeeds for Self-ActualizationWhen  all of the foregoing needs are satisfied, then and only then are the  needs for self-actualization activated.

The person feels on edge, tense, lacking something, in  short, restless. If a person is hungry, unsafe, not loved or accepted,  or lacking self-esteem, it is very easy to know what the person is  restless about. It is not always clear what a person wants wh",

A time to celebrate the new little life that has been brought into this world. A time to be thankful for the family unit that has now been increased by one or more.However, for some women, this life-altering event brings about feelings that aren’t quite as joyful, and begins a condition known as postpartum depression (PPD).Postpartum Depression DefinedThe National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) defines PPD as a mood disorder that sometimes appears in women after giving birth. Additionally, they say that this disorder typically comes feelings of “extreme sadness, anxiety, and exhaustion,” sometimes to the point where everyday activities are difficult to complete.According to the American Psychological Association (APA), as many as one in seven women suffer from PPD, a condition that can present itself anywhere from a few days up to several months post-delivery. It has no boundaries, either, because it can affect any new mother without regard to her background, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or whether it is her first time or fifth time giving birth.It’s important to note that feelings of sadness and anxiety directly after childbirth can occur without rising to the level of PPD. These are typically referred to as “postpartum blues.” So, what’s the difference?Postpartum Depression Versus Postpartum BluesOne of the main differences is that the postpartum blues condition typically appears within 2-3 days of childbirth and disappears within a week or two, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). This is different than PPD, which generally sets in anywhere from one to three weeks post-birth but can take up to one full year before it presents itself.Also, PPD often requires some type of intervention to begin to resolve, while postpartum blues generally disappears on its own. Additionally, the feelings associated with postpartum blues—sadness, anxiety, and being upset with the baby or a loved one—are usually much less intense than the feelings associated with PPD. With the latter, the new mother’s emotions are typically fairly intense, possibly even reaching the point where they become totally debilitating.For more information, go to https://online.maryville.edu/online-bachelors-degrees/psychology/about-postpartum-depression/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "n, this life-altering event brings about feelings that aren’t quite as joyful, and begins a condition known as postpartum depression (PPD).Postpartum Depression DefinedThe National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) defines PPD as a mood disorder that sometimes appears in women after giving birth.

Mary: “You said next time you’d have a strategy for me to pay off my loan and get a great job.”Joan: “Actually I said we’d work together on this.”Mary: “Whatever. What have you got for me?”Joan: “First of all, Mary, (in Solution Focused Counseling) it’s important for you to have a clear picture of what you want.”Mary: “I want my debts paid off and a good job.”Joan: “OK, so here is the miracle question - if tonight, a miracle happened and you woke up in your perfect world it would look like…”Mary: “Easy. 1.\tI’d be 20 pounds lighter and in shape.2.\tMy parents would like me – my mom that is – would like me for who I am. A History major with a three year degree.3.\tMy school debt would be gone.4.\tI’d have a wonderful job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoan: “Would you say the priority for today is #3 and #4?”Mary:  “Yes because that would likely take care of #1 and #2. Oh yeah, and  Andy and I would be married – but I won’t marry him until my debt is  paid off. He has enough money trouble, saving up to buy a café.”Joan:  “Great. So let’s look at the job part. What I have collected over the  years is a list of jobs that arts majors can get with a three or four  year arts degree. The first section is on Policing and Security. You’re a  Canadian, right? These outfits are always looking for educated recruits  without a criminal record and with good mental health:-\tRoyal Canadian Mounted Police \t(www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca)-\tOntario Provincial Police\t\t(www.opp.ca)-\tCanadian Security Intelligence Service\t(www.csis-scrs.gc.ca)-\tRegional Police. For example, Peel \t(www.peelpolice.on.ca)-\tCanadian Armed Forces \t\t(www.forces.gc.ca)Mary: “I have no interest in these. None whatsoever. No offence but …”Joan:  “None taken. I go with the motto ‘If you don’t know what your options  are, you don’t have any.’ Banking? I have a list of five banks and  security places that get a five start rating in ‘The Canadian Career Directory.’  Mary: “I’m an artsy. Hate math.”Joan: “You don’t have to be an economist or mathematician, and you can move up the ranks pretty quickly if you are keen.”Mary: “Nope.”Joan: “Ok, next on my list. With one or two more years of school you can do the following – even with an arts degree:-\tLaw school (www.ouac.on.ca/olsas) -\tTeachers’ College (www.ouac.on.ca/teas/) -\tGraduate School (http://www.cou.on.ca/) -\tMasters of Social Work. For example, Wilfred Laurier.(www.wlu.ca/homepage.php?grp_id=30)-        Masters of Librarial Science. For example, Western (www.fims.uwo.ca/acad_programs/grad/lis/mlis.htm)Mary:  “I guess you didn’t hear the part about me needing to make money and  get a job – not going back to school. Honestly Joan, I know you mean  well but I am burned out and broke.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching In Korea\n Joan: “How about a job where:1.\tYou travel abroad.2.\tYour flight is paid there and back.3.\tYour accommodation is provided – gratis –and they may even serve you one meal a day.4.\tTaxes are only 3 to 4 %.5.\tYou have a job where everyone looks up to you.6.\tYou work less than eight hours a day, five days a week.7.\tYou are paid professional wages.8.\tThe cost of living is quite cheap.”Mary: “What, drug smuggling in South American?!”Joan: “Absolutely not. In fact the very opposite. Teaching in Korea!” Mary: “Are you on drugs? I’m sorry, that was rude. But:1.\tI don’t have a teaching certificate.2.\tI have only a three year degree.3.\tI have no idea how to do the visa thing.4.\tMy partner only has a two year college degree.5.\tI don’t speak Korean.6.\tI have a cat and a dog and a guinea pig and a cockatiel.7.\tHow would I find an apartment?8.\tKoreans don’t generally like North Americans.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoan:  “You don’t need a  teaching certificate, a three year degree is fine,  the agency who hires  you will help you through the visa thing, you don’t  have to speak  Korean, and your school will get an apartment for you.  And, what was  the other thing? Right. Koreans are warming up to North  Americans. I’ve  known students – one of whom is my son – who had no  problem there  whatsoever with attitudes toward him. The partner and the pets – that’s a bit more of a challenge.”Mary: “I’m sunk. I looked on the www.Eluta.com   website you so highly recommended for finding a good job in Canada.   Nothing for me. The only job for a history major required 4 years of   experience! And the call centers and Timmies? Not for me either.”Joan:   “Mary, what IS for you?! Every job is going to have its challenges.   It’s figuring out what challenges you can live with. And actually, you   love Asian culture and history.” Mary is crying now. Joan is not  stressed by this. Mary needs to let go  of her almost reflect negativity  before she’ll be able to look for a  workable situation - to benefit  from solution focused counseling. And  Joan is compassionate - Mary  truly has a very big challenge on her  hands.Joan: “Here’s a thought. For homework this week I want you to contact Jason at www.asknow.ca.   See what he has to say about your situation and the possibilities. You   can borrow a book on this from our lending library called, ‘Great Jobs   for Arts Majors.’ And I want you to go on the web to check out the  links  on the handout I’m going to email to you called – no surprise –  ‘Great  Jobs for Arts Majors’.  Mary: “You get paid a percentage or something?!”Joan:  “No.  But I do like to refer to people and products I know will be  helpful  and knowledgeable. If you decide to teach in Korea, you don’t  have to go  through “asknow” – but they have an informative website. Nor  do you  have to follow the advice in the book or the websites. There  are other  options too, like asking your profs, your colleagues, the  career center,  going on monsterjobs.com and so on.”Mary:  “Been there, done  that. The general consensus is more schooling or  working outside of my  field in administrative stuff. Not my thing.”Session Seven with Solution Focused Counseling begins to conclude ... \n\n\n\nHeavy hearts, like heavy clouds in the sky, are best relieved by the letting of a little water. - Antoine Rivarol\n\n\n\n\nBuy  at AllPosters.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAKE ME TO THE TOP OF THIS PAGE!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Mary  arrived ten minutes late today. Joan cannot and will not  add an extra  ten minutes on the other side. This would not be fair to  the next  client and Mary needs to learn that there are consequences to  not being  punctual.   Mid Session FiveJoan: “Mary we’ve done the exercise 'The Ten Things I Like About Me'   and you’ve just said you agree with these. And yet you continue to say   awful things about yourself. I want you to think what your best friend   would think if you said these kinds of things to her…”Mary: (Stays silent.)Joan:   “She’d be really upset with you – in fact, she might never speak to  you  again. She’d be crushed and it would take her some time to get over   this. And yet you say these things to yourself day after day.”Mary: “But they are true.”Joan: “I’m going to challenge you on this with a little exercise called The Lies We Tell Ourselves (based on Cognitive Behavioral Counseling or Therapy   – because so often that is what we are doing. So Mary, tell me five   things you don’t like about yourself – and only five so make them good.”Mary: “That’s easy enough.1.\tI’m nasty to my mother2.\tI’m a lousy student3.\tI’m a slob of a housekeeper4.\tI’m fat and out of shape5.\tAnd my nose is too big!”Joan repeats these back to her…Joan: “OK, #1. So how are you nasty to your mother?”Mary: “I get really impatient with her on the phone.”Joan: “Every call? Every minute of every call? Be more specific.”Mary: “OK, not every call – but lately I’ve been getting edgy. I’m behind on essays.”Joan:   “So a more accurate description might be, ‘When my mother calls and  I’m  trying to write an essay I can be short with her.’”Mary: “That’s true.”Joan:   “You and I can take some time and work out a strategy for dealing with   this – but you see what’s going on here? You’re lying to yourself. You   say you’re nasty all the time and in fact you get short occasionally.   Very big difference and easily fixable.”Mary: Nods…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoan: “#2. I’m a lousy student. What is the evidence for this?”Mary: “I’m not getting straight A’s and part of me could care less.”Joan: “We’ve reviewed your marks. It was only in one course you failed a test and you now have a tutor for that.” Mary: “I’m not getting straight A’s.”Joan:  “Welcome to the  majority of students. You normally don’t get less that  a B and you’ve  said you don’t even have to work that hard to get B’s.”Mary: “Yeah well.”Joan:   “And you said ‘could care less’? Last session you told me you were   worried about your debt situation on graduation – that’s care.”Mary: “It feels hopeless.”Joan: “Just because you feel something doesn’t mean it’s right. Have you heard of the book ‘Mind Over Mood’ by David Burns?”Mary: “I’m a history major, not a psyche major.”Joan:   “His basic premise is that you can change the way you feel by changing   the way you think. When a person is feeling down, the thoughts become   negative. Which makes us more down, and so it goes. But if we say ‘No!’   to these exaggerated negative thoughts and ‘Yes!’ to productive  positive  thoughts – we can improve our mood and work to change  situations.”Mary: “So if I think happy thoughts, my loan will vanish?”Joan:   “If you think, ‘Hmm, I’m worried about my loans and need to take some   steps. I know, I’ll get some ideas and strategies from Joan…’ – then,   yes, you’ll have happier thoughts and a strategy for paying off your   loan. In fact in our next session how about you and develop a strategy   for paying off this loan and getting a job in your field.\"Mary: \"Let me guess, you've written a book called 'Great Jobs for Artsies!\"Joan: \"Not quite, but I'm working on a power-point for it...\"  Mary: “Hey Mary Poppins! #3 I’m a lousy housekeeper.”Joan: “What does that look like?”Mary: “I do the minimum.”Joan: “What does that mean?”Mary:   “I let dishes pile in the sink, garbage flow over the top of the  pails.  The bathroom is disgusting, and there are dust bunnies – no,   kangaroos!”Joan: “I’m glad you still have a sense of humor. So your partner Andy has two broken arms and legs?”Mary: “No, but it’s a downward spiral.”Joan: “If the two of you were to take an hour on a Saturday morning – working together – how much of it could you clean up?”Mary: “All of it. It’s a small apartment.”Joan: “So this is a lifestyle choice – you could fix this, but at this time you are deciding not to.”Mary: “I guess, if you put it that way. But I don’t feel it’s a choice. I feel absolutely flat about it…”Joan: “What would motivate Andy and you to go on a cleaning spree?”Mary: “Having company over - Andy’s an amazing chef, you know. But we don’t have company over because the place is a sty.”Joan:   “May I humbly suggest that you take the hour, do it, and then reward   yourselves with a nice breakfast out of the apartment.”Mary: “That might work actually…”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoan:  “#4 You say you are fat and out of shape. How many pounds overweight  are you according to the chart at the health office, and what does ‘out  of shape’ mean?”Mary: “Twenty pounds and a flight of stairs winds me.”Joan:  “So I will agree with part of what you said then – you are overweight –  but not obese – and you are out of shape – but you can get around  campus easily enough. This is a situation that is easily fixable if you  decide to do it.”Mary: “Why am I not feeling happier!” Joan: “Cognitive Behavioral Counseling or Therapy or ‘Challenging The Lies We Tell Ourselves’  is not about pretending problems don't exist. Rather, it’s about being  more accurate and then making the necessary changes – rather than  feeling defeated and being disempowered.”Mary: “Let me guess – you’re going to tell me my nose is biggish but not big, and fixable if I really want to…”Joan: “Who tells you your nose is too big?”Mary: “The mirror.”Joan: “So in fact YOU are saying that. Anyone else?”Mary: “They’re too polite and I really truly am embarrassed about my nose.”Joan: “So what are your options?”Mary: “Plastic surgery – eventually.”Joan: (Wants to roll her eyes, but…) “That’s one option. Isn’t there one that is less expensive and more immediate?”Mary: “If I knew, I’d be doing it.”Joan:  “Let’s try something. (Types into computer ‘how to make nose look  smaller’). Look at this! Dozens of sites called ‘How to Make Your Nose  Look Smaller.’ I’ll email this link to you. Guess you aren’t alone,  huh?! And by the way, I don’t think you nose is too big either!” Mary: “I haven’t liked this session at all. Instead of listening  to me and agreeing with me, you’ve been abrupt and disagreed with  everything I’ve said!”Joan: “I have absolutely listened to you –  but I disagree with the lies you tell yourself. I’m going to give you an  info sheet called ‘Common Thinking Errors’ - and it’s a really  good lie-detector. It highlights the ten most common distorted thinking  patterns and how to break out of them. Also, one on ‘Positive Thinking and Self Talk’ and, my favorite, ‘How to Be Your Own Best Friend.’”Mary: (Rolls her eyes.) “Let me guess, for homework you want me to do some charting.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoan: “You know I’m just itching to give you a ‘week sheet’. But I know you like journaling better. On your info sheet there is a handy little chart called ‘The ABCs of Cognitive Behavioral Counseling (Therapy).’A.\tActivating Event – the actual event and the client’s immediate interpretations of the eventB.\tBeliefs about the Event – this evaluation can be rational or irrationalC.\tConsequences – how you feel and what you do or other thoughtsSo   how about you journal when you say a nasty thing to yourself (Belief   about the event) and how that makes you feel or think or how you behave   (Consequence). Next I want you to also write down what triggered this   (Activating Event). Then I want you to think of and write down what   might be a more helpful perspective (Belief about the event) and how you   might then feel, think or do (Consequences.)”Mary: “Sounds like physics to me!”Joan: “It isn’t. Here’s an example. Situation One – Distorted ThinkingA - Mary is walking down the street, and her friend Sarah walks right on by. B – Mary thinks, “Oh Sarah is such a jerk.”C – Next time, Mary ignores Sarah.The ‘B’ may or may not be true. Here is another possibility.Situation Two – Positive ThinkingA - Mary is walking down the street, and her friend Sarah walks right on by. B – Mary thinks, “Oh that Sarah, always distracted.”C – Mary calls out, Sarah apologizes for missing her, and they go for coffee!”Mary:   “OMG! That first example happened. So I resolved not to call Sarah.  She  called me and asked ‘What’s up!?’ So I told her how hurt I was.  Sarah  was stunned. So we both apologized and went for coffee!”Joan: “Awesome! A testimony from a satisfied customer!”Mary: “You know – you’re starting to grow on me!”Joan: (Grins) “I’m glad to hear that because I’d really like you to come back for a session on Holistic Health also known as the Biopsychosocial Model. This is where we do a whole health review – physical, social, emotional, spiritual, vocational and intellectual.”Mary: “Good grief. Should I bring crystals?”Joan: “No, this is going to be more like ‘Grandma’s Rules.’”Sample Session Five - Cognitive Behavioral Counseling (Therapy) continues... \n\n\n\nIf you want to get somewhere, you have to know where you want to go and how to get there.

            "  Mary  arrived ten minutes late today. Joan cannot and will not  add an extra  ten minutes on the other side. This would not be fair to  the next  client and Mary needs to learn that there are consequences to  not being  punctual.   Mid Session FiveJoan: “Mary we’ve done the exercise 'The Ten Things I Like About Me'   and you’ve just said you agree with these. And yet you continue to say   awful things about yourself. I want you to think what your best friend   would think if you said these kin",

She’d be crushed and it would take her some time to get over   this. And yet you say these things to yourself day after day.”Mary: “But they are true.”Joan: “I’m going to challenge you on this with a little exercise called The Lies We Tell Ourselves (based on Cognitive Behavioral Counseling or Therapy   – because so often that is what we are doing. So Mary, tell me f",

So how are you nasty to your mother?”Mary: “I get really impatient with her on the phone.”Joan: “Every call? Every minute of every call? Be more specific.”Mary: “OK, not every call – but lately I’ve been getting edgy. I",

You’re lying to yourself. You   say you’re nasty all the time and in fact you get short occasionally.   Very big difference and easily fixable.”Mary: Nods…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoan: “#2. I’m a lousy student. What is ",

It was only in one course you failed a test and you now have a tutor for that.” Mary: “I’m not getting straight A’s.”Joan:  “Welcome to the  majority of students. You normally don’t get less that  a B and you’ve  said you don’t even have to work that hard to get B’s.”Mary: “Yeah well.”Joan:   “And you said ‘could care less’? Last session you told me you were   worried abou",

Have you heard of the book ‘Mind Over Mood’ by David Burns?”Mary: “I’m a history major, not a psyche major.”Joan:   “His basic premise is that you can change the way you feel by changing   the way you think. When a person is feeling down, the thoughts become   negative. Which makes us more down, and so it goes. But if we say ‘No!’   to these exaggerated neg",

I know, I’ll get some ideas and strategies from Joan…’ – then,   yes, you’ll have happier thoughts and a strategy for paying off your   loan. In fact in our next session how about you and develop a strategy   for paying off this loan and",

The bathroom is disgusting, and there are dust bunnies – no,   kangaroos!”Joan: “I’m glad you still have a sens",

So your partner Andy has two broken arms and legs?”Mary: “No, but it’s a downward spiral.”Joan: “If the two of you were to take an hour on a Saturday morning – working together – how much of it could you clean up?”Mary: “All of it. It’s a small apartment.”Joan: “So this is a lifestyle choice – you could fix this, but at this time you are deciding not to.”Mary: “I guess, if you put it that way. But I don’t feel it’s a choice. I feel absolutely flat about it…”Joan: “What would motivate",

But we don’t have company over because the place is a sty.”Joan:   “May I humbly suggest that you take the hour, do it, and then reward   yourselves with a nice breakfast out of the apartment.”Mary: “That might work actually…”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoan:  “#4 You say you are fat and out of shape.

This is a situation that is easily fixable if you  decide to do it.”Mary: “Why am I not feeling happier!” Joan: “Cognitive Behavioral Counseling or Therapy or ‘Challenging The Lies We Tell Ourselves’  is not about pretending problems don't exist. Rather, it’s about bein",

Anyone else?”Mary: “They’re too polite and I really truly am embarrassed about my nose.”Joan: “So what are your options?”Mary: “Plastic surgery – eventually.”Joan: (Wants to rol",

(Types into computer ‘how to make nose look  smaller’). Look at this! Dozens of sites called ‘How to Make Your Nose  Look Smaller.’ I’ll email this link to you. Guess you aren’t alone,  huh?! And by the way, I don’t think you nose is too big either!” Mary: “I haven’t liked this session at all. Instead of listening  to me and agreeing wit",
            "h me, you’ve been abrupt and disagreed with  everything I’ve said!”Joan: “I have absolutely listened to you –  but I disagree with the lies you tell yourself. I’m going to give you an  info sheet called ‘Common Thinking Errors’ - and it’s a really  good lie-detector. It highlights the ten most common distorted thinking  patterns and how to break out of them.

The daily investment of empathy and compassion required to help clients can take a major toll over time, and burnout can occur. Whether you provide drug and alcohol counseling, couples therapy, or help children resolve behavioral issues, knowing how to manage stress in this career field is essential to avoid burnout. Below are some helpful tips on how to recognize signs early on and take proactive steps to maintain your mental health. Signs That You’re Experiencing BurnoutCounselor burnout can be characterized by emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and feeling ineffective at the job. Without addressing these issues, it can lead to impaired functioning and reduced quality of care to your clients. Common signs that you’re experiencing burnout may include:feeling fatigued or irritablelacking motivation and dreading going to workbecoming cynical or detached from clientshaving difficulty concentrating or making decisionsexperiencing physical symptoms like headaches, stomachaches, or insomniaengaging in negative self-talkusing drugs or alcohol to self-medicatehaving sleep problemsIf any of these apply to you, you may be at risk of burnout. The earlier you take action, the better the outcome will be. Set Work/Life BoundariesIt’s important to create boundaries between your work and home. To do this, set office hours and stick to them, get away from your desk during your lunch break, and protect your weekends and vacations from the encroachment of work-related stress. Establishing boundaries will help you compartmentalize the anxiety you experience at the office so you don’t bring it home. If you happen to work from home, creating a dedicated workplace in an extra bedroom or corner of the room will assist in creating a boundary between work and the rest of your life. Develop Interests Outside of WorkIt’s easy to get consumed by counseling and let it become your entire identity. One way to avoid burnout is to cultivate interests outside of work, which may include focusing on your spirituality, revisiting an old hobby, or engaging in community service. Staying connected to your family and friends and who you are outside of your profession can provide much-needed perspective in your life. Tend to Your Mental HealthCounselors struggle with mental health issues too, so if you feel yourself becoming agitated with work, there’s nothing wrong with taking advantage of the mental health care benefits offered by your employer. You can also develop a self-care routine that may include meditation, journaling, yoga, or other wellness activities. Prioritizing your mental health will enable you to be fully present for clients.  Eat Healthy and ExerciseSticking to a nutritious diet and engaging in regular physical activity is vital in staving off burnout. Chronic stress can cause elevated levels of cortisol in the body, which is a hormone that increases your heart rate and blood pressure and instigates the natural “fight or flight” response. Prolonged elevation of cortisol can take a toll on the body, but establishing healthy habits can boost your energy and resilience to stress. Limit CaseloadsHigh client caseloads can quickly lead to burnout. To avoid this, be sure to advocate for yourself and set limits on how many clients you see per week or day. Say no to extra responsibilities that push you past your bandwidth. Continue to Grow ProfessionallyBecoming stagnant in your career can breed dissatisfaction and boredom over time. To combat this, look for opportunities to continue developing your skills through training, conferences, and certifications. Pursuing mastery of your job will keep the work engaging over the long run. The deep emotional investment that counselors make in their careers can take a toll over time. To avoid burnout, make your needs a priority. The strategies listed above will help you sustain a long, rewarding career in caring for others. Author BioKent Reason is an editor and content specialist with Ark Behavioral Health, a substance use treatment provider with locations in Massachusetts and Ohio.

Our goal at Drug Dangers is to keep the public educated and informed of all defective medical devices and dangerous medications that are currently available on the market today. Pharmaceutical companies are trusted to put safe products on the shelves, yet thousands of people lose their lives each year due to prescription medications with adverse side effects. By spreading awareness, we believe we can lower this statistic by decreasing the number of recalls, saving more lives of those who have been affected.

Between the near-constant use of cell phones, computers, and other electronics to stress from work and future events, people are in need of a different approach to handling stress. Some have found that meditation, and by extension, mindfulness, can provide a reprieve from these issues.Mindfulness is a general term that refers to the conscious act of immersing oneself in the moment. In this day and age of being “plugged in” almost constantly, this is a refreshing way to make a change in the daily routine.Mindful living is also an excellent way of learning to check in with your mental and physical health. When you are in a period of transition or high stress, it can become easy to experience mild dissociation and get out of touch with your body. Mindfulness addresses this issue in a natural, healthy way.There are many different ways to tap into mindful living. This change can be as simple as including a couple steps in your morning routine, or learning a new technique to help you maintain mindfulness through stressful situations.1. MeditateMost experts in the area of mindfulness would support the claim that mindfulness comes from meditation. The act of setting time aside in the day to be calm, practice breathing, and get in touch with your thoughts and emotions is an important practice.Meditation helps to “reboot” your body and assist in connecting what you feel physically to your mental cognition. The act of re-connecting your mind and body daily through meditation and breathing practices opens the door for mindfulness that you can practice through the entire day.To begin meditating if you have never done it, you may want to try a guided meditation using an app of Youtube videos. As you practice more and more, it will become easier to get into the right mindset for meditation, and the benefits of the practice will continue to increase.It is best to mediate for a short period of time, such as 10 or 20 minutes, and then practice being mindful a few times each day, also for shorter amounts of time. This creates a more impactful meditation session.2. Go for daily walksTaking daily walks is a wonderful opportunity not only to be in the moment and connect with yourself, but also to connect with nature. Breathing in fresh air while getting in some light exercise is an excellent way to tap into your stream of consciousness and begin to live more mindfully.To walk in a way that encourages mindfulness, make sure that you are fully in the moment. Leave your phone in the car or office, or at least put it on “Do Not Disturb”. Find a location away from traffic and excessive noise. Set a slow pace for yourself, and practice deep breathing as you take in your surroundings and appreciate the sensation of walking through nature.Practice this type of mindful walking often for best results!3. Listen to your bodyHave you ever noticed a bruise you don’t recall getting, or woken up with a painful headache? Our initial, automatic reaction may be to ignore these occurrences, or take a pain medication and move on with our day. While it may be necessary to sometimes take medications, we should remember the importance of each sensation that our body experiences.Living mindfully is a practice that begins when we attempt to bring the mind and the body closer together. This means that we must listen to what our body is trying to tell us. If you have never practiced mindfulness, this may be a very new and somewhat difficult experience. Listening to the body takes practice.For example, take a moment to be aware of your body right now. Is there tightness in your jaw or shoulders? Is your back hunched, or are you slouching? Are you subconsciously holding your breath?Taking a few moments to check in with your body can be an excellent way of being more mindful of your own emotions and stress, and allow you to gradually work towards relieving that tension.Fortunately, there are other ways that you can help your body to address your stress and tension. Mindfulness is helped by treating your body with kindness, which may include a more regular self-care treatment. Consider using a face mask, taking vitamins and supplements, or using roll-on essential oils or coconut oil. Improving the food and products that you use and consume positively impacts the way you feel and in turn, your ability to be mindful.4. Create something each dayThe simple act of creating something with your hands taps into a part of yourself that helps to engage mindfulness.For example, when you are baking bread, painting, or playing music, you must be in the moment. It is difficult to knead bread while holding a cellphone, or to play the piano while typing on a keyboard!These creative activities force us to step away from our busy schedules, turn down all distractions, and enjoy some solitude. This simple act allows us to begin listening to our inner selves and engaging in the present moment.5. UnplugThis advice may be common, but it’s for good reason. There are a multitude of reasons to unplug from technology- as it improves everything from cognition to physical health to emotion. Another unexpected benefit to unplugging? Increased mindfulness.As a society we have become accustomed to spending time with each other through screens and communicating from a distance. When we take the time to set the electronics aside, this allows us to re-kindle the human connections that are so crucial to our health and happiness.​Re-kindling these relationships and experiences is a sure way to begin living more mindfully. When we make the conscious decision to choose people over technology, opting to be in the moment, enjoy a conversation or take in our surroundings, this is when we begin to become truly mindful. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Darius Bashar on Unsplash\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

And we live in   socio-economic conditions that can enhance or demean our long-term   well-being. What  follows are two inventories – Personal Well  Being (PWB) and  Socio-economic Well Being (SWB). Items in PWB are things  that can be  addressed almost immediately – but situations in SWB take a  very long  time. Both are essential components of the whole health   check in. \n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Well Being – in a nutshell PHYSICAL HEALTH • Nutrition• “Anti-nutrients” including alcohol, junk food, caffeine, illegal drugs and nicotine use• Sleep• Exercise • Check in with Dr/NP (weight, blood pressure, blood work including hemoglobin, cholesterol and blood sugar levels, and thyroid functioning) SOCIAL – Relationships with…• Partner• Friends• Parents or Guardians• Children or Dependents EMOTIONAL • Personal time or “down-time”• Hobbies• Good sense of humorSPIRITUALITY • That which gives meaning to one's life and draws one to transcend oneself.• VolunteeringINTELLECTUAL • Our brains need regular and diverse stimulation.OCCUPATIONAL • We thrive on meaningful, paying work. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHOLE HEALTH – The Questionnaire  PHYSICALEven though these are not really True/False topics – most of us are  somewhere in between – label these anyways, just to get a sense of your  whole health!  Most of these are things you can improve quickly and  easily.  1. Nutritious food  – I have a diet chock full of veggies. T / F  2. Water  – I make a point of drinking at least four cups a day. T / F  Anti-nutrition  3. Junk Food – I avoid junk food. T / F  4. Cigarettes  - I don’t smoke. T / F  5. Alcohol  – I don’t drink. Or I limit myself to no more than one a day. T / F  6. Illegal Drugs  – I don’t use them. T / F  7. Caffeine  – I don’t use caffeine. T / F*****  8. Sleep  – I get at least 8 hours a night. T / F  9. Exercise  – I get the equivalent of one hour of fast walking every day. T / F  10. Check in with Dr/NP - I've had a physical assessment within the last year. T / F \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOCIAL – Relationships with…  11. Partner  – I have a special person in my life who cares about me, and I care for that person. T / F   12. Friends  – I have pals I can talk to or go out with. T / F    13. Family -  I get along with family well enough. T / F  EMOTIONAL  14. Personal time  or “down-time” – I have “me” time. T / F    15. Hobbies   – I enjoy a pursuit that is different from my job. T / F    16. Good sense of humor – I love to laugh. T / F   SPIRITUALITY  17. Religious practice – I have a sense of meaning in life that transcends myself. T / F    18. Volunteering  INTELLECTUAL  19. My brain   gets regular and diverse stimulation.  T / F OCCUPATIONAL  20. Meaningful, well-paying work  work (with a good benefits package) have I.  T / F   OTHER (Bonus Point) 21. RESILIENCE  – I can bounce back from disappointments.  T / F  TOTAL: T=F= How did you do with the Personal Well Being part of the whole health  check in?  Want to change any of these? It’s within your control – but  as always I encourage you to get an accountability partner if you have  areas you need and want to change. You need a strategy and a “mom.” Next, let's take a look at the  Socio-Economic Well Being  of the whole health inventory.\n\n\n\nBooks and Videos \nBooks“It's All in Your Head: Change Your Mind - Change Your Health” by Mark C.

Now that we’re free to move around, many of us would choose to continue to work from home. A recent survey indicates that half of Canadians working in Ontario acknowledged flexible working practices as a result of the pandemic. Remote work hasn't just freed people from the office, it has also made it possible for people to support themselves while living wherever they want. If the idea of being paid to work remotely while living anywhere, or even while exploring the world appeals to you, these digital nomad tips from Basic Counseling Skills can help you get started. 1. Find a Compatible JobIf time working from home has made you reassess what you want out of work and out of life, then find a job that you can take anywhere. Examples of good jobs for digital nomads include: blogging, customer service, consulting, web design, selling products online, software development and freelance writing, but that’s not all. Many jobs that would have been expected to show up at the office, went online, so it’s part of mainstream work culture now. Starting your own freelance business is a good way to maintain control over your schedule. This may be necessary when you could be in the middle of a move or dealing with an area with no internet access. Luckily, Elon Musk’s satellite internet Starlink will be available in even the most remote rural areas. 2. Make Sure You Can Get PaidDealing with money can sometimes be a hassle when you don't stay in one place all the time. Traditional banks are sometimes hesitant to open accounts for people who don't have permanent residence, and if you plan to travel overseas, the payment situation can be even more complicated. Take advantage of all the help you can with customer invoicing software that will let you add a button to make invoices instantly payable online, and keep up to date with paid invoices automatically recorded. You can also use this software to set up recurring invoices, which frees you up to handle different tasks. 3. Sign Up for a Virtual Mail ServiceFiguring out how to get your mail and packages while traveling around used to be one of the biggest hassles of living a nomadic lifestyle. However, you can make this process easier by signing up for virtual mail service. These services provide you with a physical address where your mail and packages can be sent. You can have important mail forwarded to you or have it scanned so you can read it online. 4. Find a Tech-Friendly RentalSince you plan to move around, it probably doesn't make sense to buy a home. One of the features you should look for in your rental is how tech-friendly it is. Can you get reliable high-speed internet? Does the home have adequate outlets and nice-to-have features, such as built-in places to charge your devices or a work center you can access? Fast Wi-Fi is important, but you probably want to be able to do more than work. Look for a rental that is close to activities you enjoy. Consider also traveling with a few items to add more positivity to your temporary spaces. Bring along comfort items to make the place yours and to set the tone for a favorable stay. Technology has made it possible to explore the world without having to be independently wealthy or constantly hunting for short-term jobs. After some soul searching, if getting your work in harmony with your life goals means working remotely, it can feel like a big step. But once you get the hang of being a digital nomad, you may wonder how you ever lived any other way.  Image from www.pexels.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Now that we’re free to move around, many of us would choose to continue to work from home. A recent survey indicates that half of Canadi",
            "ans working in Ontario acknowledged flexible working practices as a result of the pandemic. Remote work hasn't just freed people from the office, it has also made it possible for people to support themselves while living wherever they want. If the idea of being paid to work remotely while living anywhere, or even while exploring the world appeals to you, these digital nomad tips from Basic Counseling Skills can help you get started. 1. Find a Compatible JobIf time working from home has made you ",
            "reassess what you want out of work and out of life, then find a job that you can take anywhere. Examples of good jobs for digital nomads include: blogging, customer service, consulting, web design, selling products online, software development and freelance writing, but that’s not all. Many jobs that would have been expected to show up at the office, went online, so it’s part of mainstream work culture now. Starting your own freelance business is a good way to maintain control over your schedule",
            ". This may be necessary when you could be in the middle of a move or dealing with an area with no internet access. Luckily, Elon Musk’s satellite internet Starlink will be available in even the most remote rural areas. 2. Make Sure You Can Get PaidDealing with money can sometimes be a hassle when you don't stay in one place all the time. Traditional banks are sometimes hesitant to open accounts for people who don't have permanent residence, and if you plan to travel overseas, the payment situati",
            "on can be even more complicated. Take advantage of all the help you can with customer invoicing software that will let you add a button to make invoices instantly payable online, and keep up to date with paid invoices automatically recorded. You can also use this software to set up recurring invoices, which frees you up to handle different tasks. 3. Sign Up for a Virtual Mail ServiceFiguring out how to get your mail and packages while traveling around used to be one of the biggest hassles of liv",
            "ing a nomadic lifestyle. However, you can make this process easier by signing up for virtual mail service. These services provide you with a physical address where your mail and packages can be sent. You can have important mail forwarded to you or have it scanned so you can read it online. 4. Find a Tech-Friendly RentalSince you plan to move around, it probably doesn't make sense to buy a home. One of the features you should look for in your rental is how tech-friendly it is. Can you get reliabl",
            "e high-speed internet? Does the home have adequate outlets and nice-to-have features, such as built-in places to charge your devices or a work center you can access? Fast Wi-Fi is important, but you probably want to be able to do more than work. Look for a rental that is close to activities you enjoy. Consider also traveling with a few items to add more positivity to your temporary spaces. Bring along comfort items to make the place yours and to set the tone for a favorable stay. Technology has ",
            "made it possible to explore the world without having to be independently wealthy or constantly hunting for short-term jobs. After some soul searching, if getting your work in harmony with your life goals means working remotely, it can feel like a big step. But once you get the hang of being a digital nomad, you may wonder how you ever lived any other way.  Image from www.pexels.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

From buying a new home to changing careers, going through a big life shift can be challenging, even if it’s a positive change. However, you can use this time to make healthy choices and introduce better habits into your lifestyle. For instance, if your new job is closer to home, you might consider riding your bike or walking to work on nice days. Think about a few areas where you might be able to make positive choices as you navigate transitions. Here are some ideas from Jane McGill Counseling to help you get started. Get rid of workplace stress Job stress is a common problem for many individuals, so if you’ve been feeling overwhelmed at work or just aren’t satisfied with the progress you’ve been making, now might be the perfect time for a change. Before seeking a new position, you should create an eye-catching resume by utilizing a free online resume template. You can choose from a library of professionally designed resume templates, and then add your own text and graphics. First, read up on the best solution for how to write a great resume, including what skills you should list and how to format it. Also, if you have entrepreneurial aspirations, starting your own business will allow you to take control of your career and put your ideas out into the world. These days it’s easier than ever to become an entrepreneur. Starting a business can be a daunting experience, but it doesn't have to be. With the help of an online formation service, creating your LLC can be a breeze. These services offer a simple and efficient process to help you form your LLC quickly and easily. They take care of the documents and legal requirements, freeing you up to focus on other aspects of your business. Plus, using an online formation service is typically much more affordable than hiring an attorney. Pursue Higher Education You can also earn a degree online if you'd like to change your job and advance in your career. One example is a business degree, which allows you to learn the latest skills in management, taccounting, or communications. Signing up for an accredited online program makes it easy to work full-time and keep up with your studies, as you can study anywhere you have an internet connection. As you research affordable schools, you may consider this option. Address your living situation If you are stuck in a bad living situation, it can make all of life's other stressors feel that much worse. However, there are online resources available that can help you find a better spot to call home. By comparing rental rates in your area, you can ensure that you are getting a fair deal for your money. Additionally, you can often filter your search by amenities, location, and other criteria to ensure that your next home suits your needs and lifestyle. Rid yourself of toxic relationships While workplace stress can leave you feeling less confident, Well and Good notes that toxic relationships can also have a negative effect on your self-esteem and pull time and energy away from the things that matter most to you. Major life changes can sometimes make us aware of how we’re being treated by others. Take a look at your relationships–whether they’re at work or with friends–and assess how they affect you. Here are a few things to consider:Do they respect your boundaries?Do they take accountability for things they’ve done to upset you?Do they tend to take advantage of your time or energy?Do they gossip about you to other people in your friend group?Do you feel emotionally or physically drained after spending time with them?   It can be challenging to deal with a toxic relationship, but by removing that stress from your life, you can finally focus on your own mental and physical health needs. Use this time to develop positive friendships with new social acquaintances or to work on damaged relationships with family members. Get outside and get active Whether your life is changing due to a new job, a move, or a relationship transition, think about how you can use this time to boost your physical health. If you were previously overworked, for instance, and never had much free time, you might make it a priority to spend more time outside by picking up a hobby such as gardening or running. Focusing on your wellness can help to improve your mental health as well as your physical well-being, and, as TripOutside points out, getting out into nature has several advantages. Sleep better for a ton of benefits Reducing stress, tackling toxic relationships, and getting active outdoors can all contribute to another area that may need a little work: your sleep quality. Changing your rest habits can have a multitude of positive effects, from improving your cognitive abilities to allowing you to boost your overall physical health. You can make the most of your sleep time by removing electronic devices from your bedroom, adding comfy bedding, or utilizing a white noise machine for deeper sleep. No matter what types of changes you’re going through in life, there are always ways to make them more tolerable. By using this time of transition to improve your career, going back to school to earn a degree, using online tools to make moves like starting a business easier, and reducing stress, you can focus on your needs and make those life changes positive ones. Jane McGill Counseling uses a variety of therapies to help clients, from behavioral therapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, to mindfulness and EMDR.

For  example, let’s say the client has gone into a lot of detail about a  traffic jam and the effect on his blood pressure and his resulting visit  with the doctor and the rude nurse and and and…  To paraphrase would be  to say in a tentative voice,“So after the traffic jam you felt your  blood pressure was up, and the doctor confirmed this…?”\n\n\n\n\n\nBy doing this you are letting your client know that you understand  and, if you don’t, are willing to be corrected. AND you are helping her  or him to “cut to the chase.” What would not be helpful to say right now  is, “So you have an anger management problem!?” It may be what you are  thinking, but you want the client to keep talking and for the client to  come to that conclusion on her or his own.By the way, this is a good time to take interest in the tone of your voice.  Be watchful of whether it is…•\tHigh / low •\tLoud / soft\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n•\tFast / slow•\tAccommodating / demanding•\tLight-hearted / gloomyModeration in all things including voice. And remember, the person may  not remember what was said, but they will remember how you made them  feel!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Class Homework - Trying Out Paraphrasing: 10 minutes of listening and restating in a compact sympathetic way, and 5 minutes of feedbackListener - Get ready to actively listen and get into your encouraging body language.  Ask an OEQ like, “What brings you here today?”  You want the speaker to go on at some length.Speaker - Talk away!A few minutes later...Listener - Take what the speaker is saying and condense it – watching tone. You want to sound tentative.Speaker - Let the listener know if she/he is on the right track. ***** Speaker1. Did you feel you were being sympathetically heard?2. What percentage correct was the speaker?  Ten percent?  90%? How come?Listener1. How was it to listen with the understanding you would be paraphrasing back to the speaker?2. Did you feel you were “on the same page”?  If not, why not?Don’t  worry if you are not completely accurate.  That is why the listener  “plays it back” to the speaker using a tentative tone.  Remember! The person may forget what you said, but will never forget how you made them feel!Time to do the switcheroo! ***** Out of Class HomeworkLook for opportunities to practice paraphrasing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't look at me in that tone of voice! - David Farber\n\n\n\n\nBuy  at AllPosters.com\n\n\n\n\ntake me to the top of the page!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

But as you navigate the path of recovery, you must start building a firm financial foundation for your future. Here's how you can work towards achieving financial stability, presented to you below by Jane McGill Counseling.Update Your Resume & Cover LetterThe first step towards financial stability is securing stable employment. A steady job provides a regular income and establishes a routine – a crucial aspect for individuals in recovery. Start by updating your resume, highlighting skills and experiences that make you a valuable candidate. Don't overlook any volunteer work or courses you've undertaken during your recovery journey, as they demonstrate resilience and a willingness to learn. Then, focus on crafting a compelling cover letter. This is your chance to tell potential employers about your strengths and why you're a good fit for their company. If writing isn't your strong suit, use online resources such as Indeed or Monster for helpful tips and templates.Clearout Outstanding DebtsDebt can be a significant barrier to financial stability. Make a list of all your outstanding debts and create a plan to pay them off. Prioritize high-interest debts and consider seeking advice from a financial counselor if necessary. Consolidating your debts could also be an option, potentially reducing the interest you pay across multiple accounts. Remember, every payment made is a step towards a debt-free life.Prioritize Health CoverageYour health should always be a priority, especially during recovery. Health insurance can help cover costs associated with medical appointments, therapy sessions, and medication, providing peace of mind and avoiding unexpected expenses. Ensure you understand your policy thoroughly - what it covers, what it doesn't, and how much your out-of-pocket costs will be. This knowledge will prevent surprise bills and help you budget more effectively. Remember, investing in your health now can save you from costly medical bills in the future.Build a Financial Safety NetAn emergency fund serves as a financial safety net. Aim to save enough to cover at least three to six months' worth of living expenses. Start small if necessary, even a little amount each week can add up over time. Consider setting up automatic transfers to your savings account to make the process easier. Over time, this fund will grow and serve as your cushion against unexpected expenses or income loss. This emergency fund can also reduce stress, knowing you have a backup if needed.Implement a Financial PlanA well-planned budget can help manage your income and expenses, preventing overspending and helping you save. Track your monthly spending, categorize your expenses, and then create a realistic budget. Remember, the goal is to spend less than you earn. Regularly reviewing and adjusting your budget will ensure it continues to meet your changing needs and financial goals. And don't forget, every successful financial plan starts with a commitment to stick to it.Boost Your Credit HealthCheck your credit report regularly and take steps to improve your credit score. Pay bills on time, reduce your debt, and avoid applying for new credit unless necessary. A good credit score will help you secure loans or credit cards with lower interest rates in the future, contributing to long-term financial stability. Additionally, promptly dispute any inaccuracies on your credit report - they can unfairly lower your score. Maintaining a healthy credit score is an ongoing process but one that is crucial for your financial well-being. Overcoming addiction is a significant accomplishment, and achieving financial stability is a vital next step. Finding stable employment, clearing outstanding debts, and understanding your health insurance are key actions. Building an emergency fund and implementing a budget can help manage finances effectively. Regularly improving your credit score contributes to long-term stability. Each step towards financial independence marks progress away from the instability often linked to addiction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In this article, I will share my top journaling tips for beginners.Sometimes, I write tips and how-to posts that really work for me. Then a couple weeks later, all my good habits start falling apart.In fact, there are days I feel hypocritical writing about journaling. You see, I don’t always maintain a perfect writing streak. Just like all of you, I often get distracted by the little things in life. But, here’s the thing you really need to understand: journaling isn’t a hobby, it’s a habit. You can’t just journal when you feel good. It’s the habit you develop that you need the most when you’re feeling depressed or anxious. And you don’t need to beat yourself up whenever you’re unable to write. Journaling is an excellent check-in tool. There are some seasons in your life when you feel motivated or balanced and you even have your priorities straight. On the other hand, there are times when you feel stressed and life seems pointless. But, the value of journaling can only be seen when you stick with it especially during the ups and downs.Here are some of the best journaling tips that have helped me in real life.#1. Keep a Traditional JournalWriting on a piece of paper forces you to slow down. It also helps relieve stress. I know a lot of people who prefer journaling online. However, I love using a traditional, hard-bound journal. The trick is to be self-aware. Jot down your thoughts as and when you feel comfortable. Use art, doodles and sketches to express your emotions.#2. Start Small and Be RealisticIt’s important to be realistic especially when you’re building a new habit. Don’t think of writing a page or two every day. There are days when even half a page will seem like a dreadful task. For such days, I like to keep it precise. 3-4 lines of journaling help me get through such days. You can also start with 1-2 lines. What matters when you start writing is that you write to form a habit. Once you get used to it, it will become a part of your routine. #3. Practice GratitudeThere are going to be days when you will have writer’s block. Doing so helps you lift your spirits and gets your thoughts flowing again. The best part is that it’s not complicated. You can start with things that are in front of you — your pets or your terrace garden. Next, describe your emotions in detail. Try to focus on a few things rather than filling up the page with a lot fof things. Allow yourself to feel every emotion as you write. The practice of gratitude journaling has been life-changing for some people. It has proven to help you navigate through stressful situations and even toxic relationships. Ask yourself: “Despite all the bag things, what can I learn from this difficult day?” This simple question will change your whole perspective and help you live a happier life. #4. Make Journaling a PleasureYou should view journaling as a pleasure and not another thing to cross off your list. Invest in pretty stationary. Dab on your favourite perfume and brew your favourite tea before you start journaling. You can even turn on your favourite song and settle into a comfortable corner to get you in the mood. Associate these little indulgences with journaling so that they make your time a real pleasure. The TakeawayJournaling is an incredible tool that you can use to transform your life. These 4 journaling tips for beginners will help you form the habit of journaling. Remember to start small and feel the emotions as you write. Keep trying and hopefully, journaling will help you navigate your life. Author Bio: Shristi Patni Shristi is a content writer and owner of F and B Recipes.

It's part of the job. And while they are trained to deal with these situations, they can still take an emotional toll. That's why it's so important to have a support system in place to cope with the stress and trauma of the job. Here are some tips from the Jane McGill Counseling that have helped other officers deal with PTSD:Read about PTSDLearning as much as possible about PTSD is the first step to better understanding the condition and how it affects people. There are some excellent books out there on the subject, such as:The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der KolkTrauma and Recovery by Judith HermanThe Invisible Wounds of War by Terence M. Keane and Stephen J. Cozza   These books will help you understand what PTSD is, how it develops, and how it can be treated. You might benefit from reviewing scientific studies too, which offer in-depth research into the condition in various settings. Keep in mind that you'll probably notice pieces in different formats when researching. If you run across a study and want to convert it to your preferred format, use a simple online tool. For instance, you can convert a PDF to view it on your Kindle.Maintain Important RelationshipsOfficers must maintain their close relationships with family and friends. These people will be there  when they're most needed. They can provide us with the love and support we need to overcome difficult times. Be vigilant about spending quality time with your loved ones, and make time to see or talk to your closest friends. Moving back to a familiar place can provide an excellent opportunity to reconnect with former classmates. It can be a chance to reminisce about old times, catch up on life events, and potentially rekindle valuable friendships. An online school database can be instrumental in this process, allowing you to look up and reach out to your old peers. This could be through a school's alumni association website or a social media group dedicated to your graduating class. Remember to approach this process with respect for people's privacy and openness to the changes that have likely occurred over time. Reconnecting with old friends can add a comforting sense of familiarity and community to your move back home.Join a Support GroupThere are many excellent support groups for police officers dealing with PTSD. Talking to other officers who have been through similar experiences can prove invaluable on your journey. It can also help you feel less alone in your struggles.Focus on Stress ReductionStress reduction is crucial for individuals dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD can often lead to overwhelming feelings of anxiety, anger, and fear, making it difficult for individuals to manage their emotions effectively. Through stress reduction techniques, such as mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, and physical activities like yoga, individuals with PTSD can lower their stress levels, promoting a sense of calm and helping them to better cope with their symptoms. Research has shown that combining stress reduction techniques with other PTSD treatments, such as therapy and medication, can lead to more positive and long-lasting outcomes for those struggling with the disorder. Get a Fresh StartMoving to a new location can often be a significant step towards finding a fresh start, especially for individuals living with PTSD. The change of environment can provide a break from triggers that might cause retraumatization and offer a chance for new beginnings. Searching online for a place to rent initially can be a practical approach. This allows you to experience living in the new area without making a permanent commitment immediately. Over time, as you become more comfortable and certain about the location, you can then consider finding something more permanent.Meet With a TherapistTherapists can provide us with vital tools for coping with PTSD. They can help you process our trauma safely and healthily, and every officer could benefit from meeting with a therapist at least once a year (if not more often). Research online, ask for referrals and speak with several therapists until you find someone you connect with.Eat Well and ExerciseTaking care of your physical health is essential for dealing with PTSD, meaning you must ensure that you're eating healthy foods and staying active. Exercise is especially important because it releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting properties. A consistent fitness routine can also help you get better sleep at night.  Pick Up a HobbyDoing something we enjoy outside of work can help relieve stress and give you a sense of satisfaction. Think of a hobby you've always wanted to try or a childhood activity you've wanted to revisit. It can be anything from playing a musical instrument to hiking to painting. Whatever it is, it should be something that brings you joy. Find a hobby that helps you cope, and do it at least once a week.Get the Care and Support You Need​Traumatic events are part of policing. But that doesn't lessen the emotional toll they take on your mind and body. It's essential to have a support system in place to help you cope with the stress and trauma of the job. By reading about PTSD, maintaining important relationships, joining a support group, meeting with a therapist, and establishing a healthy routine, you can deal with your PTSD effectively and learn how to help others along the way. For a trauma informed approach to therapy which aligns well with my therapy style that focuses on relationship building first, contact Jane McGill Counseling today! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Some people know exactly what they  need this time of year to counteract these feelings, while others are never sure what to do and suffer in silence. If you’re among the latter group, it’s time to turn things around and say goodbye to SAD stress. From Basic Counseling Skills, here’s how to reduce your stress this season and find new ways to manage the winter blues. Make Time for Self-Care at Home and at Work Seasonal depression makes it easy to let your self-care routine fall by the wayside. But as ZenBusiness notes, whether you’re seeking happiness at work or at home, it’s important to remain vigilant when it comes to taking care of your mind and body. By taking a few important steps, such as prioritizing wellness by eating healthy, exercising, and getting enough sleep, avoiding negative self-talk, and focusing on doing your best rather than perfection, you can be happier and healthier in all areas of your life — even as you battle seasonal stress. Budget Wisely Recovering from holiday spending tends to throw us for a loop once the bills come due in January. And concerns with financial stress can contribute to SAD. Rather than succumbing to the stress, make a point to sit down and review all of your expenses, then determine what expenses you can cut. Eliminate unnecessary subscriptions, cut back on dining out, forgo a daily stop at your local coffee shop and focus more on buying shelf-stable ingredients that you can use to produce delicious, healthy and affordable meals. Manage Stress with CBD Oil Rather than turning to alcohol to quell anxiety or to battle your blues, consider a more natural approach with CBD. According to Real Simple, people often turn to CBD oil to reduce their stress and symptoms of anxiety because it has a noticeable calming effect. While CBD is derived from the cannabis plant, it is a non-psychoactive substance, so it doesn’t result in a “high” like THC. With so many retailers flooding the market with new CBD products, you’ll want to buy your CBD oil from a retailer with a good reputation. Despite CBD’s reputation for safety, talk to your doctor before using it to make sure they give you the go-ahead, and be sure you try it at home before driving or working. Consider a Getaway A great way to counteract seasonal blues is to get away to somewhere sunny. Even if it’s chilly where you’re looking to travel, guaranteed sun offers a great alternative to cold, gray days. If you choose to travel this time of your life, the last thing you want to deal with is a flight delay. The good news? By being selective about which flights you book, you can reduce your chances of being delayed. According to Forbes, you should try to get a seat on the earliest flight of the day whenever possible — you’re less likely to have your departure time pushed back. Avoid choosing flights with short layovers so that you have a buffer in case your first flight arrives a little late. Do you wish you could save time at security and arrive at your gate early? You might want to consider signing up for TSA Precheck. When you’re able to walk past the line, you’ll realize why the extra cost is worth it, especially during busy travel days.Photo Source: Unsplash\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Rather than succumbing to the stress, make a point to sit down and review all of your expenses, then determine what expenses you can cut.

Sum-ups happen at the beginning and at the end of a session.In a beginning summary you are recalling what happened at the last meeting.In an ending one, you are attempting to condense what has happened over 40 minutes into a few minutes worth of material.In  both cases your tone needs to imply that you are open to some changes  in perspective. It’s important the both the client and you are “reading  from the same page.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\tYou came in today because you are feeling depressed. 2.\tYour school work is not going well.3.\tYou worry your boyfriend doesn’t love you.4.\tYou are also unhappy with the amount of stress your parents are putting on you to get A’s.Would you say this is accurate?Note:  I don’t use numbers in a session – I just put them here for  clarification.

Whether it’s leaving a job, moving to a new city, or embarking on a new relationship, change can be daunting, scary, and exhilarating all at once. While some people are naturally skilled at adapting to major life changes, others may struggle with the transition. The key to embracing major life changes and thriving is to approach them with an open mind, a positive attitude, and a willingness to learn and grow. Read on for some insights from counselor Jane McGill.Embrace Change as It Occurs Major life changes can be difficult, whether it's a new job, a move to a new city, or a significant relationship shift. However, as Livi notes, the first step in successfully navigating these changes is to accept them as they come along. It's normal to feel a range of emotions when faced with new situations, but resistance only leads to frustration and stress. Instead, approach change with a positive mindset and a willingness to explore new opportunities. Embracing change means keeping an open mind and being willing to try new things. With this mindset, you'll not only adapt more easily but also learn and grow in the process. Ultimately, accepting change is key to living a fulfilling life, one that's full of growth and adventure. Make a Career Change One of the biggest life changes that people face is a career change. Whether you’re transitioning to a new field, or starting your own business, changing careers can be a thrilling and rewarding experience. One of the best ways to thrive during a career change is to digitize work-related documents. This can save time, space, and money while allowing you to work more efficiently and effectively. When you digitize files and save them as PDFs, you’re able to edit documents with ease. In order to merge PDF files, there are several tools available online that can make the process easy and seamless; check this out to get started. This tool is free and all it takes is dragging and dropping your file into the interface, then saving it and downloading it. Digitizing your work-related documents not only makes it easier to transition to a new career but also allows you to keep all your important files in one place. It can be overwhelming to manage physical documents when starting a new job or launching a new business, but by taking advantage of technology, you can streamline your workflow and reduce stress. Additionally, having all your documents digitized means that you can access them from anywhere with an internet connection, making it easier to work remotely or collaborate with others. Engage in Self-Care When faced with major life changes, it can be easy to get caught up in the stress and chaos of the situation. However, it’s important to remember that taking care of yourself is crucial during this time. Science of People points out that self-care practices can help you stay grounded and centered, allowing you to better navigate the challenges that come your way. Making sure you get enough sleep, eat healthily, and exercise regularly are all simple but powerful ways to take care of your physical well-being. By prioritizing self-care, you can ensure that you’re better equipped to handle any major life changes that come your way. Start a Hobby Like Gardening Taking care of your mental health is crucial in maintaining overall well-being, just like taking care of your physical health. Changes and challenges in life can often affect our mental health, and it’s important to prioritize self-care during these times. While there are many ways to practice self-care, engaging in a healthy hobby such as gardening can help relieve stress and bring a sense of calmness and peace. Gardening allows us to connect with nature, which has been shown to have a positive impact on our mental health. It also provides an opportunity to practice mindfulness, which means being present and fully engaged at the moment. Whether you have limited space or a large outdoor area, gardening is a fun and therapeutic activity that can help improve your mental health and well-being during times of upheaval or transition. Accept the Challenges of Change Major life changes can feel overwhelming and daunting, but they also present an opportunity for growth and self-discovery. Instead of getting caught up in feelings of fear or uncertainty, try to approach the change with a positive mindset and see it as a chance to challenge yourself. Embrace the discomfort that comes with trying something new and unfamiliar and use it as an opportunity to learn and expand your horizons. While challenges can be difficult at the moment, the skills and knowledge that you gain from them can last a lifetime. By pushing yourself out of your comfort zone, you may discover new passions and talents you never knew you had. Remember that change is inevitable, but how you choose to approach it is within your control. Boost Your Career If you're considering a major career change, going back to school for a degree can be a daunting but exciting prospect. Pursuing higher education can open doors to new opportunities, allowing you to advance your career and increase your earning potential. Fortunately, in today's digital age, online degree programs make it easier than ever to go back to school while still maintaining your work and personal commitments. This may help mitigate some of the financial and logistical challenges that often come with pursuing a traditional on-campus degree. However, before enrolling in a program, it's important to do your research and choose a degree that aligns with your interests and career goals. This may help ensure that your investment of time and money results in a more fulfilling and rewarding career path. Embracing major life changes is not always easy, but it is essential for personal growth and development. It requires a combination of openness, positivity, and resilience to navigate the uncertainty and challenges that come with change. One way to embrace change is by being open to new opportunities and experiences, whether it's changing your career, going back to school online for a degree that can advance your career, or exploring new hobbies and interests. It's also important to approach changes with a positive attitude, focusing on the possibilities and opportunities that come with change rather than dwelling on the difficulties. Resilience is key when facing setbacks and obstacles, and it involves adapting to change and bouncing back from adversity. Lastly, remember to be kind to yourself, take things one day at a time, and celebrate your successes along the way. With the right mindset and a willingness to learn and grow, you can thrive during even the most challenging times. Jane McGill is here to help you on your healing journey.

She doesn’t call or  email for a  cancellation   – she just doesn't show. When Joan first started counseling, she took   this very personally – thought there was something terribly wrong with   her.Now Joan is  more careful to remember that this is about the  client, not her. If the  client was not happy with the session, she had  the option of changing  counselors.Still,  Joan cares – she knows  Mary is feeling so low. So she puts a call in to  Mary – and gets the  answering machine. She leaves a friendly message,  “Hi Mary! It’s Joan.  We had a meeting today at 2 pm. It’s now 2:15. If  you would like to  rebook, you are welcome to call the front desk at  #4321 and ask them to  let me know you have rebooked.\" If Mary didn’t  have a private phone,  Joan would have sent her an email.Joan would dearly love to know if Mary had booked a health appointment – but doesn’t have a permission to release information form   filled out to request this information. The downside of client   confidentiality is that – without written permission – you cannot go   asking around.Joan  is also aware that sometimes all a person  needs is to be heard, to be  really heard. By admitting they have a  problem, reflecting on it,  saying it out loud, and getting some  perspective – that’s all some  folks need to start resolving the issues.  Perhaps this is what has  happened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSession Three - Cancellation\n\nMary called in a  cancellation in advance. All clients are informed by reception if they  miss two appointments in a row, they will have to provide reasonable  explanation for why this happened – in writing. Curiously, Mary didn’t  cancel her fourth appointment. Yet she hasn’t contacted Joan either.And  then, a few days later, Joan gets an email. “Joan, I’m sorry I didn’t  show up for our second appointment and I had to cancel the third. I was  just feeling so lousy I couldn’t face it. After our first appointment I  felt really good. Like I could beat this. And then ‘boom’ – I felt worse  than ever.\"\"I did go see the doctor and he recommended an  antidepressant as well as counseling. That really p*ssed me off too. But  today I had a moment of clarity – I felt like I used to. So I called  the pharmacy and got the prescription filled. The pharmacist insisted on  talking to me. I was hoping for a ‘magic bullet’ – that if I took this  today, I would feel better right away. She told me that antidepressants  work best in conjunction with counseling and was insistent that I take a  list of counseling services with me.\"\"Tra-da! The university’s  counseling service was listed. I mentioned your name and she knew of  you. So I’m back! See ya Tuesday! Oh yeah, and thanks for calling.”Joan writes back a friendly short email. “Hello Mary, I am  very glad to hear from you. Good for you for seeing the doctor and  following up with the meds. I look forward to seeing you soon! BEST! /  joan”This pattern of disappearing after a first or second session  is not the norm, but neither is it unusual. Clients feel such relief in  getting something off their chest and think this feeling will continue –  and then the clouds come back. They can feel discouraged, even angry.  All of us like quick fixes, but life isn’t like that. Building and  maintain good health – physical, social, emotional, spiritual,  intellectual and vocational – is a full time endeavor!Joan has  made a point of building a rapport with the university clinic’s health  team and with the pharmacy team at a local store. In this way she has  people she can comfortably contact regarding medical questions and her  clients already have a known team to go to. But as importantly, she  keeps in touch with student associations, the university psychologist,  off campus mental health clinics, and other community services.As you see, Joan always has homework too!And by the way, Joan will never know if Mary actually did take the prescribed medication.  Sometimes just knowing that one could if one needed to, is all a person needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEighty percent of success is showing up. - Woody Allen\n\n\n\n\nBuy  at AllPosters.com\n\n\n\n\ntake me to the top of the page!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Believing in yourself is one of the best things you can do to make your personal and professional goals a reality. Here are six things you can do to build confidence and make the most of exciting opportunities in Green Valley, AZ.1. Commit To Working OutBy starting and sticking to a fitness routine, you can feel healthier and look great, which in turn improves confidence levels. Physical activity may feel tough while you're in the moment, but when you finish a hard workout, you can be proud of your efforts. Plus, the more you exercise, the stronger you'll feel and the easier it will be to reach your physical goals, whether you're running a 5K or hiking in Green Valley.2. Stick to a Healthy DietRegular exercise and a balanced diet go hand in hand to help you feel and look your best. By fueling your body with healthy foods full of nutrients, you have a better chance of staying healthy and focused on your future goals. Aim for ample fruits, veggies, and protein to keep you fueled throughout the day for more confidence physically and mentally.3. Make Time to RelaxIf you want to build confidence, you need to give yourself the time to relax and reconnect. Quality relaxation time helps you connect with your emotions and channel your stress into positive motivation. Relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, and yoga can soothe physical and mental stress, making you feel more confident overall.4. Explore a New Career PathWhen you feel stuck in a rut at work, you may feel better with a career change. Perhaps it's time to take a leap of faith and start your own business where you're fully in control. You'll need a business plan outlining your company, business structure, services, finances, and selling plan so you can look forward to a bright business future.5. Consider Further EducationNearly 16 million Americans were undergraduate students in 2020. By going back to school, you can challenge yourself and enjoy newfound confidence that pays off in the workplace. An online business degree is a prime example, as this coursework develops your knowledge of management, marketing, leadership, and other critical business skills.6. Visit a Mental Health ProfessionalAround 40 million U.S. adults are diagnosed with anxiety disorders. If you're struggling with anxiety and depression, chances are your self-confidence and motivation will take a hit, too. It's best to visit a mental health professional for a confidential discussion, as they may recommend therapy and medication to alleviate symptoms, as well as provide you with available medications for depression. While antidepressants aren't suitable for everyone, if they prescribe you medication, a mental health specialist can monitor you for side effects and support you on your journey to better health.Achieve Your Goals With Greater ConfidenceWhether you're re-entering the workforce after time off or picking up a new hobby, having confidence will go a long way. Remember, you deserve to live your best life, and making reasonable changes to boost your confidence will bring you closer to your goals.Check out Basic Counseling Skills to help your self-confidence journey.Image via Pexels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Assets identified may include: 1.  Physical Health, 2. Social Supports, 3. Emotional Resilience, 4.  Spiritual Outlook, 5. Vocational/Financial, and 6.  Intellectual/Giftedness. You can use the Whole Health Inventory to identify these.Positive  Thinking or Learned Optimism is about learning a new perspective.  Instead of projecting what can go wrong, the client is encouraged to  focus on what can go right – since it’s all speculation anyway. Key  questions are “What can I learn from this?” and “What good can come from  this?” In this way, a negative situation is not a total defeat – it’s a  temporary setback, a learning experience.*****  \"Founder\": Martin Seligman (1942 - )Habits of  thinking need not be forever. One of the most significant findings in  psychology in the last twenty years is that individuals can choose the  way they think. - Martin Seligman *****Practitioners of these particular modes of counseling assert that we should be:•\tas concerned with strength as with weakness•\tas interested in building the best things in life as in repairing the worst•\tas concerned with making the lives of normal people fulfilling as with healing pathology• \toutspoken about the research supporting a Strengths Based approach, and  the anecdotal evidence of people who practice Strengths Based or  Positive Thinking / Learned Optimism. Constructive or hopeful people  fare better in almost all aspects of life. Some will argue that the  Law of Attraction  is a current version of Positive Thinking. Others put LOA in a category on its own. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechniques\nThere are a variety of Strengths Based techniques. You could do a  whole health inventory to look for strengths to build on, and use these  to address a particular problem or challenge. The question becomes,  “What resources does the client have to address this problem?” For  example, a single father wants to return to school. His resources may  include OSAP and a bursary, the in-laws for child care, public housing  for lower rent, and used books to save money.Another example. The  challenge is the family matriarch who is 90 and wants to stay in her  home, even though she no longer drives – plus she has no family in town.  What are the supports for her? It could be that a member of her church  will take her to and from church for Sunday service and the mid-week  meeting. She can take a taxi to get groceries and her pharmacy will  deliver her medication. For Christmas the family has decided to buy her  the services of a cleaning lady once a month. Home care will come in to  assist her with her personal care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo Helpful Easy Exercises\n\nTHE TEN THINGS I LIKE ABOUT ME!This is strengths based  exercise for self-esteem building - you simply ask the client to come up  with ten things s/he likes about her/his self. Counselor Joan did this  with client Mary in Sample Session Four.   In counseling we spend so much time on what isn’t working and neglect  what is working. When we feel more empowered by taking a strengths based  approach we are better able to take on our problems.If the  client is really struggling with ideas, you can ask, “What would your  friend _____ say if I asked her/him?” Then you can ask about the  possible response of partner, parents, and – as a last resort – good  things you know about the client.I make it into a poster and give copies to the client to place where s/he can see it.\n\n\n\n\nGRATITUDE JOURNALAnother worthwhile undertaking is the “Gratitude Journal”. Part One – Day EndAt   the end of the day the person is asked to list four things that she/he   is grateful for, that went well. And they must always be stated in the   positive. Here is what I might write down even on a day where lots of   things have gone wrong:•\tReally good cup of coffee at 10 am•\tRode my bike to work, there and back•\tWatched a you-tube video about a cat that made me laugh and laugh and laugh•\tHubby made a great salad at suppertimeA person doesn’t have to limit the list to four things – I aim for ten.Part Two – Day BeginningOver   their breakfast your client can be encouraged to write down four  things  she/he has to look forward to today. Again, here is how my list  might  look even if my day is likely to be very stressful:•\tAm going to watch a movie tonight•\tWill have peanut butter and banana sandwich at lunch – yum, yum•\tEllie (a colleague) and I will have a lunch time walk•\tCan listen to classical music today while writing (overdue) reports.At the end of Session Four, Joan makes this suggest to Mary. When I give a journal to clients I include an unusual pen – just to jazz things up a bit! \n\n\n\nFurther Reading and Videos\nBooks“Learned Optimism: How to Change Your Mind and Your Life” by Martin E.

No matter the age of the person, over time addiction can alter brain chemistry, cause serious health complications, lead to legal repercussions, and lead to job loss and financial issues. Eventually, serious drug or alcohol abuse increases a person’s risk for suicide and death. So what can you do if someone you love is struggling with substance abuse? Here, Basic Counseling Skills provides some helpful resources.Is Your Loved One An Addict?Addiction is a serious disease that changes a person’s body chemistry to make them dependent on the psychological and physical effects of drugs or alcohol. It’s not always easy to spot addiction. Sometimes people will hide their destructive behavior until it is out of control. The term “high-functioning addict” is often used to describe those who maintain a functional day-to-day life while abusing their substance of choice. However, eventually all substance abusers – even the high-functioning ones – will break and succumb to the destructive effects of letting drugs or alcohol control their lives. Early intervention can help prevent the most devastating effects and make recovery a less difficult endeavor. Look for the early warning signs of addiction:Changes in behavior or mood swingsSocial withdrawalNeglecting obligationsChanges in appetiteDental decayLack of attention to hygiene or appearanceSeeming spaced out or distractedRed, bloodshot, or glassy eyes.Sudden complaints of feeling ill or having flu-like symptomsProblems at work or schoolFinancial issuesExcessive fatigue or agitationSudden changes in social groupPhysical changes such as losing weightAvailable Treatment OptionsAlthough addiction affects many, there is not one right way to treat it. What works for one person may not work for another. Sometimes, substance abusers will need to try multiple avenues of treatment before finding a combination of therapies that work for them. It’s important to show your loved one patience, but it is also just as important to be up front and honest with them. Treating addiction is never easy and feeling supported can be a major boon to a person’s recovery efforts. You can also help them to find programs or facilities that offer treatments they want to pursue. Listen to them carefully to ensure you understand what options they want to try, then search together for rehab centers in your area that offer those programs. Note that many facilities offer both inpatient and outpatient options, so know what your loved one prefers moving into their treatment. Here are some of the addiction treatment options available:The 12-Step Program is a system used by Alcoholics Anonymous and other compulsion therapy groups like it. When going through the 12-steps, the participants surrender themselves to their “higher power” while they seek healing through the process of making amends, taking a moral inventory, admitting fault, self-reflection, and participating in service.Religious-based recovery methods often use the 12-Step Program, but instead of simply using the concept of a vague “higher power,” the treatment is more specific about which higher power the person is surrendering to.Holistic drug rehab programs seek to treat the whole person mentally, spiritually, and physically. The idea behind holistic drug treatment is that if one aspect of the person is suffering, it will affect the other aspects just as much. Holistic drug treatment doesn’t just treat addiction, it also addresses the underlying concerns that contribute to it.  Encourage Your Loved One to Take ResponsibilityDuring the worse phases of their addiction, many people create financial messes, and some may lose their jobs. These financial hardships, combined with the cost of treatment may feel overwhelming. Once the acute phases of treatment have been completed, it may be worthwhile to encourage your loved one to transform a hobby into a part time job, such as baking, or selling their crafts. In addition to generating income, this can be a source of pride and self confidence. While you should never carry the burden of being your loved one’s counselor or only confidant, you may find it helpful to learn some basic counseling theories as you support them through this process. Basic Counseling Skills can be a great resource for this information. The site is organized like a book, so you can read through it at your own pace and return to specific places of interest.​Find Ways to Support Your Loved One’s JourneyAddiction is a disease that affects both the mind and body. Seeing the signs of addiction is not always easy, but in time the problem eventually destroys the addict’s life. Seeking treatment as early as possible can help mitigate problems. There are many treatment options available – 12-step, religious, holistic, etc – and each person responds to treatment differently. It’s important to be patient and supportive as a person struggling with substance abuse goes through recovery. Doing so helps improve their chances of making it through treatment and returning to create healthy and productive lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

That is substantially faster than the national average for all occupations. This growth is credited to the increasing opioid epidemic and the improved awareness and acceptance of mental health issues. With less stigma, more people are seeking out counseling. If you’re interested in pursuing this career field, here’s a look at how to get started and the four top career options. Getting Started To begin, you’ll need to get a bachelor’s degree in psychology, human services or if your school offers it, counseling. From there you'll need to go on to graduate school and get a master's degree. While there are some entry-level positions available in counseling that only require an undergraduate degree, to become a fully licensed and certified counselor you'll need a graduate degree.You'll also need the field experience that is part of the master's degree program. Finally, you'll need to get licensed. Exact requirements vary by state, but they all include an exam and some also include continuing education requirements. And last but not least, to get your dream job, you’ll have to everything in your power to present the perfect resume.Now let’s take a look at the top 4 career paths in counseling. Substance Abuse CounselorAs a substance abuse counselor you will work with individuals and groups, helping them to identify and deal with their addictions, and once they get clean and sober, you’ll be able to offer support to keep them on the right track. Substance abuse counselors work in hospitals, treatment facilities and in private practice. School CounselorSchool counselors work in all levels of education. You’ll work one on one with students and also in tandem with special ed teachers and other professionals when needed. Primary areas of treatment include peer pressure, academic performance, and family issues. You may also assist students with decisions surrounding career choices. School counselors are also needed after traumatic events when students may need support and grief counseling.Marriage and Family CounselorAs a marriage and family counselor, you'll work with couples and families rather than individuals. Aside from assisting couples with marriage problems you may also counsel blended families and help with parenting issues, and other interpersonal relationships. Marriage and family counselors are certified through the Association of Marital and Family Therapy Regulatory Boards. Mental Health CounselorMental health counselors are the most common type of counselor. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics nursing homes and residential care facilities employ the most mental health counselors. As a mental health counselor, you'll treat individuals and groups dealing with depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses. You may also work with people in crisis who feel suicidal.No matter which path you choose, you are sure to find satisfaction in helping people feel better, escape addiction and lead happier lives. It is a challenging yet rewarding profession! Check with your local college to see what programs are available and to get more information on careers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by Weebly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "1 \n \nTherapy Session 2  \nAnnotated Trans cript  \nJudith Beck, PhD, and Abe  \nFrom Cognitive Behavior Therapy: Basics  and Beyond, 3rd E d. \nJudith:  \nHi. Good to see you again. \nAbe:  \nHi. \n \nMOOD CHECK  \nJudith:  \nCan I take a look at your scores?  \nAbe:  \nSure.  \nJudith:  \nWhile I'm looking at these, just tell me, in your own words, how you've been \nfeeling this week.  \nAbe:  \nWell, I would say I think a little bit better. I don't know if I know exactly why, but I feel a little bit better.  \n \n[Dr. Beck will return to why he  thinks he’s a little better to reinforce the idea \nthat the change is due to his change in thinking and behavior. ] \n 2 \n \nWhen I woke up in the morning, I was able to get up more easily. I think that \nwhen I was just reading the paper, even the sports section, I felt like I was able to concentrate a little better.  \n \n[Dr. Beck uses this positive data later and provides positive reinforcement \nthroughout the session .] \nJudith:  \nOh, that's wonderful. I'm really glad to hear that. It looks like you're sleeping \nbetter too?  \nAbe:  \nWell, I think that what I meant by that was mostly that I didn't oversleep.  \nJudith:  \nOkay.  \nAbe:  \nBecause I had been spending a lot of time in bed. I would say I got up at 7:00  a.m. , \nbut I didn't really get up at 7:00  a.m. \nJudith:  \nOh, that's great. That's great. Looks like your concentration  on things, like reading \nthe newspaper, you said, that's a little better , too? \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nOh, I'm really glad. You said you don't have any idea as to why you're feeling \nbetter ? \nAbe:  \nMaybe tha t's not entirely fair. Maybe it's because of the things that we're doing \nhere that are helping.  \nJudith:  3 \n \nOh, that's great.  \n \nSETTING THE AGENDA  \n \nWe'll get to those things in just a minute, but let's set the agenda. What would be \nyour goal for today's session?  \nAbe:  \nWell, I guess to start thinking about working on the things that make it difficult for \nme to do things to get better. Like we talked about going out and doing things. \nAnd last time we talked about what I would like to be  doing, like by Labor Day.  \n \n[Having Abe think concretely and create an image about how his life could \nimprove by a certain date gave him hope that his life could get better. ] \nJudith:  \nWhat's something that you would like to be able to do, but you've been having trouble doing? With something, either going out, or in the apartment . \n \n[“Thinking about working on difficult things is too broad,” so Dr. Beck helps him \nbe more specific. ] \nAbe:  \nWell, it's kind of like the evenings are really hard for me because even if I g o out \nand do something, then at the end of the day, I go back and I'm there by myself. Then I'm just sort of there with my thoughts.  \n \n[Dr. Beck labels the goal as “evenings,” that is, to change his behavior and \nthinking at those times. ] \nJudith:  \nGood, okay, so we'll try to get to evenings. Anything else? Any other goals you \nhave?  \nAbe:  4 \n \nI would say that that's probably the main thing. Well, I should do something about \nmy apartment. I don't keep after that like I should.  \nJudith:  \nYou w ant to get your apartm ent in better order?  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nOkay.  \nAbe:  \nBut that seems like such a big job. I don't know where to start.  \n \n[Dr. Beck emphasizes teamwork .] \nJudith:  \nWell, maybe we could figure out together where to start.  \nAbe:  \nOkay.  \nJudith:  \nThat sounds good.  \n \n[Dr. Beck keeps track  of what they’re doing and then contributes to the agenda \nherself. ] \n \nSo, we're setting the agenda.  I'd also like to talk a little bit more about these \ndepressing thoughts that you've been having, and talk some more about credit, if \nthat's okay.  \nAbe:  \nOkay.  \n  5 \n \n \nREVIEWING THERAPY NOTES: PART ONE  \n \n[It’s not enough for clients to read the therapy notes on their Action Plans \n(formerly called homework) every day. It’s important to reinforce them in \nfuture sessions by asking for their reaction to them.  In this part of the session, \nDr. Beck asks Abe about his therapy notes from the evaluation session, which \nhad been two weeks before the current session. ] \nJudith:  \nWhat I'd like to do next is just to turn to the  notes from, actually, from the \nevaluation, and then the notes from last session.  \nAbe:  \nOkay.  \nJudith:  \n(being collaborative) If it's all right, I'll just read this  and I'd like you to tell me \nwhat you think about this now. \"When I start to feel more depressed,  remind \nmyself that the therapy plan makes sense.\" Does it still make sense to you? \nAbe:  \nYes, it does.  \nJudith:  \n\"With Judith's help, I'll be working toward goals every week, step by step. I'll learn \nhow to evaluate my thinking, which might be 100  percent  true, or zero percent  \ntrue, or someplace in the middle.\" What do you think about that?  \nAbe:  \nWell, I think the idea of working toward goals every week is a good idea. I think \nthat your helping me to figure out what those things are is good. If I evaluate my \nthinking, which may be 100  percent , or not, or somewhere in the middle - \nJudith:  6 \n \nWe really haven't done that yet;  help you evaluate your thinking. We' ve just been \nidentifying your thinking. But does it make sense to you that you might still be \nseeing the world through black glasses?  \nAbe:  \nMostly. \nJudith:  \nYes. Not all your thoughts are 100 percent  true.  \nAbe:  \nI think most of my thoughts are, but when I go out and do things, then I feel \nbetter when I'm doing them.  \nJudith:  \nThat's terrific.  \nAbe:  \nI don't have as many black dots now.  \nJudith:  \nYes. It sounds like this next part is true, then?  \"The way I'll feel better is by making \nsmall changes in my thinking a nd behavior every day\" ? \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nExcellent. We covered it just a little bit last session, so I want to talk about it more \nthis session. \"Give myself credit for doing things on the Action Plan , for doing \nanything else that helps me get over the de pression, and for anything that's even \na little bit difficult, but I do it anyway.\" Were you any better at giving yourself \ncredit this week?  \nAbe:  7 \n \nI think so. Last week, I hadn't really done that much that I really felt that I \ndeserved any credit. But I tried to push myself this week and do the things we talked about, so yeah. I was better because I was able to recognize  that.  \nJudith:  \nThat's great.  \nAbe:  \nI was pushing myself and doing it.  \nJudith:  \nIn a few minutes, maybe we'll talk about keeping a credit list, so we'll get to that , \ntoo. \n \nUPDATE ( BEST PART OF THE WEEK ) AND  DRAWING CONCLUSIONS  \n \n[In a traditional CBT therapy session, we generally ask, “What should I know \nabout that happened since the last time I saw  you?” Clients who are depressed \nalmost always report only negative situations. In Recovery -Oriented Cognitive \nTherapy, we ask about positive experiences and help clients draw positive \nconclusion s about them .] \n \nOkay. So, again, what was the best part of this past week? Or, when did you feel \nthe best? When were you at your best?  \nAbe:  \nWell, all of the things , just going out for a walk is better than sitting on the couch. \nBut I went out with my grandson again, and that was good.  \nJudith:  \nEthan again?  \nAbe:  \nEthan.  8 \n \nJudith:  \nWhat  did you do with him?  \nAbe:  \nWe just went out and got ice cream again.  \n \n[Dr. Beck becomes conversational, trying to lighten the mood and show \ninterest. ] \n \nJudith:  \nVanilla?  \nAbe:  \nI tried a different flavor this time.  \nJudith:  \nDid you? What  did you try?  \nAbe:  \nIt was a chocolate swirl thing . It was different.  \nJudith:  \nWhich do you like better? The vanilla the week before ? \nAbe:  \nI don't know.  \nJudith:  \nAbout the same.  \nAbe:  \nI like trying something new.  \nJudith:  9 \n \nGood for you. So, you were at your best when you took Ethan for ice cream \nagain ? \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \n \n[Dr. Beck helps Abe draw positive conclusions about the experience. ] \nJudith:  \nWhat was good about taking him for ice cream?  \nAbe:  \nI think it's just fun to be with him and just talk about stuff, and to feel kind of like a normal person.  \nJudith:  \nYeah. So, you felt less depressed when you were out with him?  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nYeah. That's good. Does that imply that actually you might be able to do things \nthat can help you feel better?  \nAbe:  \nI guess so.  \n \n[Dr. Beck asks a question so Abe will conclude that this difficult action had \nbecome easier.]  \nJudith:  \nWas it easy to go out with him, or was it still hard?  \nAbe:  \nIt was easier than the first time. It was a lot easier than the first time.  10 \n \nJudith:  \nOh, good. I'm glad.  \nAbe:  \nI still have some questions, but it was a lot easier.  \n \nREINFORCING THE COGNITIVE MODEL  \n \n[Dr. Beck next seeks an explanation for why this action was easier , identifies an \nadaptive cogn ition that was different from what he had previously thought, and \nsubtly reinforces the cognitive model. ] \n \nJudith:  \nIf it was easier, it makes me think that your  thinking  must have been different. \nWhat were you thinking  when you were getting ready to go out with him ? \nAbe:  \nI was thinking, \"Well, last time went pretty good, so, no reason to think that this \ntime won't be good too.\" So, I was just sort of more able to look forward to it  as I \nwas going to do it.  \nJudith:  \nThat's terrific.  This time you were making a positive prediction and your mood \nwas better ? \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nAnd it made it easier to go out.  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  11 \n \nREVIEWING THERAPY NOTES: PART TWO  \n[Dr. Beck checks on how often Abe read his therapy  notes and reviews the notes \nfrom the previous session .] \nJudith:  \nOkay. I want to just get back to the therapy notes from last week,  too. Were you \nable to read these every day?  \nAbe:  \nI did, yeah. I read it every day.  \nJudith:  \nWere you able to pull them out any other times during the day? I'm not sure we \neven asked you to do that.  \nAbe:  \nAfter I got up in the morning and took a shower and s tuff, I would read it.  \nJudith:  \nRight, right. Okay. So, tell me what you think of this  [reading] : \"When I criticize \nmyself, remember, I'm only looking at part of the scene, and it's through black \nglasses. Judy says it's not my fault. It's happening because I have depression.\"  \nAbe:  \nI think that there's some truth to that.  \nJudith:  \nUh-huh [nods “yes” ]. Do you think you're accepting this fact more, that you do \nhave a real illness? Last week, I think it was a hard thing to even think about.  \nAbe:  \nI think that was the first time that I really thought about it in that way. When you \nwent down and read the list of things to me, \n \n[Dr. Beck had shown him the diagnostic criteria in the DSM.]  12 \n \n \n I could say, \"Yeah, that's me.\"  \nJudith:  \nThat's you.  \nAbe:  \nSo, I think that i t's in a book, it must mean something.  \n \nJudith:  \nYeah. Are you thinking now that your condition is more like pneumonia?  \n \n[Dr. Beck had given him an analogy , helping him conclude that he would have \nhad some of the same symptoms--low energy, low motivation, difficulty pushing \nhimself —if he had pneumonia. But he wouldn’t have criticized himself for these \nsymptoms. This psychoeducation helped him see that he had a very real \ncondition, which, in turn, helped him to be less self -critical. ] \nAbe:  \nI guess so.  \nJudith:  \nSomething that happens that has these really negative symptoms, makes \neverything harder ? \nAbe:  \nYeah. \nJudith:  \nThen we talked about, last week, about how your thinking influences how you feel and what you do. Were you able to catch any of those automatic thoughts this week? I don't think I even called them automatic. They're just your depressed thoughts.  \nAbe:  13 \n \nJust my thoughts. Yeah.  \nJudith:  \nDid you catch any this week?  \nAbe:  \nYeah. I guess the worst one was like when I said that sitting on the couch is hard, \nso when I was sitting there, there would be times when I would think that I'm not \ngoing to get better.  \nJudith:  \nUh-huh [nods “yes” ] When you had that thought, how did that make you feel?  \nAbe:  \nBad.  \n \n[Dr. Beck doesn’t ask him to specify what “bad” means because she wants to \nemphasize a different point. ] \nJudith:  \nWere you able to remind yourself at all that just because you think something, doesn't necessarily mean it's true?  \nAbe:  \nYeah, I did. I can't say I believe that 100 percent , but I believe it more than I did in \nthe beginning.  \nJudith:  \nOkay. That's good.  \nAbe:  \nThen, probably in my weaker moments, I said, \"This isn't going to work.\"  \nJudith:  \nUh-huh [nods “yes” ].  Meaning this therapy?  \nAbe:  14 \n \nThis therapy  and all that. So, I went out and had ice cream with my grandson. \n[expressing additional automatic thoughts] Well, I ought to be doing that anyway. \nI went for a walk. Well, I ought to be doing that anyway.   \nJudith:  \nSo, you got really self -critical?  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nYeah. All right. I think I'll come back to the rest of the Action Plan in a few \nminutes . \n \n[Dr, Beck decides not to address the self -criticism directly at this point, but \ninstead to teach Abe a technique to counteract self -criticism. His previous \nAction Plan had been to give himself credit. Now Dr. Beck will help him do this \nin an organized way that will help him focus more strongly on this task and \nremember what he has identified. ] \n \nKEEPING A CREDIT LIST  \n \nJudith:  \nLet's talk about a credit list,  [being collaborative]  if that's all righ t? \nAbe:  \nOkay.  \nJudith:  \nIt seems to me that you've lost a lot of confidence in yourself.  \n \n[Dr. Beck summarizes his  difficulties in a normalizing, no n-pathological, way.]  \nAbe:  15 \n \nLosing my job really hurt.  \nJudith:  \nYes.  It seems to me you've lost confidence in a lot of ways. You've lost confidence \nabout your ability to work. You're afraid that even if you got a job, you wouldn't \ndo it very well. Seems like you've lost confidence in your ability to keep your \napartment in order. Lost confidence in how other people might view you. It \nmakes it harder to get together with friends. Do y ou think I'm right about this?  \nAbe:  \nYeah. And we haven't even talked much about my ex -wife. About the fact that the \nmarriage failed. That's pretty bad too.  \nJudith:  \nWell, it's not surprising that you've lost confidence in yourself  [providing \npsychoeducation]  because that's what depression really does. It really makes you \nlose confidence. It would be really, really important for you to r ecognize that you \nare taking steps to take control of your life again.  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \n \n[Dr. Beck provides a rationale. ] \nJudith:  \nThat's why I'd like you to keep a credit list, in writing, if you can. Y ou could just \nkeep it on any kind of piece of paper, or you could keep this credit list on a three -\nby-five card that you keep in your pocket, or you could keep a list on your phone.  \nAbe: \nThis is just like my saying  “Good job ” to myself?  \nJudith:  \nYeah, exactly. Exactly. This is when I want you to do it. We talked a little bit about this at the evaluation.  \n 16 \n \n[Dr. Beck reminds Abe of the guideline for giving himself credit.]  \n \n Whenever you do anything that's even a little bit difficult, but you do it anyway, \nyou deserve credit for that.  \nAbe:  \nOkay.  \nJudith:  \nShould I write that down on your Action Plan  for you?  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \n[Dr. Beck writes the item on Abe’s Action Plan and returns to the analogy of \npneumonia. ] \nNow, if you had pneumonia, and yet you were able to get yourself out of bed, you \nwere able to go to the supermarket, you were able to put in a load of laundry, \nwould you think you deserve credit for it?  \nAbe:  \nYeah. Only because, even though I think I'm supposed to do them, I haven't done \nthem for a long time.  \nJudith:  \nThat's exactly right. The depression has been so severe, it's been so hard for you to do these things.  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nIt sounds to me as if you've done some things this week that were even a little bit \ndifficult, but you did them anyway. Is that right?  17 \n \nAbe:  \nYeah. Going for the walks, and I walked by the church one day , too. \nJudith:  \nOh, that's great. All right, so we can start your credit list right now. Should I give \nyou a piece of paper?  \nAbe:  \nI can write it on here.   \n \nJudit h: \nOkay.  So, you said this week you walked by the church?  \nAbe:  \nMm-hmm [nods “yes’] . \nJudith:  \nIt was easier to take your grand son out for ice cream. Was it easy?  \nAbe:  \nNot easy, but  easier.  \nJudith:  \nOkay, so if it was even a little bit difficult , then it goes on the list.   Took Ethan out \nfor ice cream.  \n \n[It’s a good idea to have clients practice writing the list in session by having \nthem reflect on what they already did that day.  Starting an Action Plan like this \nin the session makes it far more likely that the client will continue it at home. ] \n What did you even do today  that was a little bit difficult, but you did it anyway?  \nAbe:  18 \n \nWell, yeah, I don't know that this was even on the list, but when I... After I got up \nand took my shower this morning, I straightened up a couple things in the apartment.  \nJudith:  \nOh, that's great. Was that even a little bit difficult?  \nAbe:  \nIt was really hard.  \nJudith:  \nOkay, so write that on your list.  \nAbe:  \nI didn't make a big dent in everything that needs to be done , I just moved them \naround a little bit. Kind of make it a clearer path to walk through.  \n \n[Dr. Beck is careful not to get sidetracked by asking more about this topic at this \npoint , especially since Abe had put it on the agenda  and she knows they will get \nto it later .] \nJudith:  \nRight. We have that on our agenda to talk more about today.  \nBut you did some things around the apartment, and we hadn't even talked about your doing that.   Was it good that you did that, or would it have been better if \nyou hadn't done it?  \nAbe:  \nIt was good I did it.  \nJudith:  \nIt was good you did it, so it absolutely belongs on the list. How about getting out of bed? Was that easy today?  \nAbe:  19 \n \nIt was a lot easier.  I wake up, and lots of times I just stay in bed. But what I've \nbeen trying to do is push mysel f to actually get out of bed when I wake up at 7:00  \na.m. \nJudith:  \nI see, instead of lying in bed.  \nAbe:  \nSo, I pushed myself and got up.  \nJudith:  \nAll right. So, can you write down, \"Got out of bed\"?  \n \n[Given what Abe said earlier in the session, Dr. Beck anticipates that he will \nhave a similar automatic thought that could interfere with a recogn ition that he \ndeserves credit for doing this.  She normalizes a very common thought. ] \n A lot of people say, \"Well, why do I deserve credit for getting out of bed, it's just \nwhat I should do?\" Is that something you were thinking?  \nAbe:  \nOh, yeah.  \n \n[Dr. Beck uses self -disclosure  to encourage Abe to give himself credit. ] \nJudith:  \nOkay. So , I have to tell you that every morning when I get out of bed, I give myself \ncredit. Because I would much rather turn off the alarm and go back to sleep, but I \ndon't. And I say, \"Well, it's good you got up.\" And I'm  not even depressed.  \nAbe:  \nOkay.  \nJudith:  20 \n \nSo, Abe, once you're over the depression, it will be your choice as to whether you \ngive yourself credit for getting out of bed or not. But while it's still even a little bit difficult, it's really important.  \nAbe:  \nOkay.  \n \n[Next, Dr. Beck reinforces t he rationale for keeping a credit list. Rather than \ntelling him why, she asks him a question, prompting him to think about it. ] \nJudith:  \nCan you see how giving yourself credit for these things might help you build up \nyour confidence, show you that you are able to do things that are difficult?  \nAbe:  \nI wasn't thinking about it that way, but I just kind of feel better thinking about it, that I'm doing those things. But I have to somehow remind myself that it has to \ndo with building confidence , too. \nJudith:  \nYes, that's good. Should I write that on your Action Plan , too?  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nSo, [writing]  \"When I do anything that's even a little bit difficult, give myself \ncredit,\" and how should I phrase it? “ This will build my confidence ”? \nAbe:  \nThis will build my confidence.  \nJudith:  \n[writing]  \"This will build my confidence.\" Anything else you did today that was \neven a little bit difficult?  \nAbe:  21 \n \nNo. I thought about doing something, but I didn't do it.  \n \n[Again, Dr. Beck is careful not to get side -tracked . She judges that sticking with \nthe credit list is more important. ] \nJudith:  \nUh-huh [nods “yes’]  How about coming to therapy today? Was that even a little \nbit difficult?  \nAbe:  \nYeah. Yeah.  \nJudith:  \nOkay. That goes on your list too. So, \"Came to therapy.\" So, we have a bunch of \nthings that you did just even today, that you deserve credit for. Now, if you don't give yourself credit for those things, what happens?  \nAbe:  \nThen I just think about it the same way I always did, that I ought to be doing that stuff anyway.  \nJudith:  \nYeah. So, you feel, what, guilty, you feel bad?  \nAbe:  \nFeel bad, guilty, lazy, incompetent.  \nJudith:  \nRight. Instead of, \"Wow, these  things are hard because I'm depressed.\" So, of \ncourse  you deserve credit for doing them. Right?  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nDo you think you could keep a list like this every day?  22 \n \nAbe:  \nYeah, I could . Maybe it would help if I would do this while I'm sitting on the couch \nat nigh t. \nJudith:  \nOh, that's a great idea.  \nAbe:  \nBecause that's when I have trouble.  \nJudith:  \nYeah, okay. So, \"Keep list. Do at night.\"  \n \n[Dr. Beck anticipates a problem and normalizes i t.] \n \nNow, the only problem with only  doing it at night is that, if you're like most \npeople, you're likely to forget 90  percent  of what you actually did.  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nI see you're wearing the rubber band.  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nRight. Did that work to have you ask yourself what was going through your mind?  \nAbe:  \nYeah . That's how I realized that the evenings were difficult because I was,  I was \nsitting there and having a hard time. Normally, I'd just go get a beer and not think \nabout it. But because of this, I thought about it.  \nJudith:  23 \n \nTerrific.  \nAbe:  \nThen I knew what the thoughts were.  \n \n[Dr. Beck offers a solution to the problem. ] \nJudith:  \nI wonder if you could use the rubber band to remind you not only to look for your \ndepressing thoughts, which might or might not be true, but to also ask yourself, \"What have I done in the last hour, or two hours, or something like that, that I deserve credit for?\"  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nSo, using the rubber band as a reminder.  \n \nACTION PLAN REVIEW and DRAWING CONCLUSIONS  \n \n[Dr. Beck has finished reviewing the therapy notes part of the Action Plan and \nset a new Action Plan to keep a credit list. Now , looking at her notes,  she \nreturns to the rest of the Action Plan and helps Abe draw positive conclusions \nabout his experiences. ] \n \nJudith:  \nOkay, so back to what you got done this past week, were you able to take a look \nat the goal list?  \nAbe:  \nYeah. Right here.  \nJudith:  24 \n \nDo you have any changes on that?  \nAbe:  \nNo. Visiting family is still really important. Still the idea about the job, like I really \nwant one, but I'm still afraid I'll mess it up.  \n \n[Again, Dr. Beck wants to stay on track . She  notes a potential agenda item  but \nthen returns to reviewing the Action Plan. She recognizes that,  if Abe is willing, \nthey should probably postpone a detailed discussion of a job until he’s made \nmore improvement. ] \nJudith:  \nYes. So, if we have time, maybe we'll get back to that.  [writing] “Mess up job. ” \nAbe:  \nThis was one of the things I said I'd thought about, but I didn't do. I thought about \ncalling up one of my friends, but I didn't.  \nJudith:  \nUh-huh [nods “yes’]  Well, I think we had agreed that that might be too hard for \nyou.  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nSo, I don't think that was even part of your Action Plan . Let me just see what was. \n\"Walking by the church.\" You said you did that. Did you visit the kids, other than \ntaking Ethan for ice cream?  \nAbe:  \nWell, when I went to see Ethan, the other kids were there. So, I spent a few \nminutes playing with them.  \nJudith:  \nThat's great. You were going to go out to the supermarket. Were you able to do \nthat?  25 \n \nAbe:  \nI did, yeah. It's just good to have some vegetables and stuff in the house instead \nof just eatin g everything out of a can.  \nJudith:  \nAnd you were supposed to try to get out of the house at least four times this week. Were you able to?  \nAbe:  \nYeah, I did. If I get to count going out with Ethan as one of those times . \nJudith:  \nOh, sure. Was it even more than four?  \nAbe:  \nWell, I walked by the church one day. I did maybe five days.  \nJudith:  \nOh, excellent.  \nAbe:  \nFive.  \n \n[Next, Dr. Beck finds out how Abe wants to continue this Action Plan in the \ncoming week.]  \nJudith:  \nSo, what would you like to do this week in terms of getting out of the house?  \nAbe:  \nI'm afraid to set the bar too high, so, maybe five times.  \n \n[Dr. Beck wants to make sure that Abe will be successful.]  \nJudith:  26 \n \nWhy don't we give you a range? How about four to six times? How does that \nsound?  \nAbe:  \nI should be able to do that.  \nJudith:  \nShould I write that on your Action Plan ? \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \n[writing] \"Get out of house four to six times.\" Okay.  \n \n[Dr. Beck asks important questions to help Abe draw positive conclusions about \nhis experience, then writes them down as part of Abe’s therapy notes that he \nwill review daily in the coming week. ] \n \nSo, you were able to get out of the house. What was good about getting out of \nthe house? What did it show you?  \nAbe:  \nWell, one, that I can do things that, up to this point, I just thought I couldn't do.  \nJudith:  \nRight. I'm writing that down. \"I can do things I thought I couldn't do.\"  \nAbe:  \nWhen I do them, I feel good about it.  \nJudith:  \nYeah.  [writing]  \"When I do them, I feel good about them.\" So, does this imply t hat \nmaybe you can start to take more control over your mood?  \nAbe:  27 \n \nMaybe it does.  \n \n[Noting some uncertainty, Dr. Beck asks Abe to put this concept in his own \nwords. ] \nJudith:  \nSo, what should I write down about that?  \nAbe:  \nWell, I think it's still more in the form of a question in my head. Does this mean \nthat?  \nJudith:  \nHow about a , “Maybe this means? ” \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nIs that about right?  \nAbe:  \nYeah, maybe it means that.  \nJudith:  \nMaybe this means what? I can take more control?  \nAbe:  \nThat there are things I can do t o take control.  \nJudith:  \nYes, exactly.  [writing]  \"There are things I can do to take control.\" That's excellent. \nOkay. I want to talk just a little bit more about depressing thoughts.  \n  28 \n \n \nPRIORITIZING THE AGENDA  \n \n[Dr. Beck gives Abe the choice of how to spend the rest of the time in the \nsession.]  \n \nThen, maybe we can talk about getting your apartment in order, or would you \nrather talk about evenings? If we only have time to get to one of those, which would you like to get to?  \nAbe:  \nEvenings.  \nJudith:  \nEvenings, okay.  \nAbe:  \nYeah. They're a problem.  \nJudith:  \nYes. Okay, we'll do that.  \n \nREINFORCING THE COGNITIVE MODEL  \n \nJudith:  \nSo, you were able to catch some of these depressed thoughts this week, right?  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nSo, what do you think of this idea that the way that you feel, say, for example, as you're taking a walk, or as you're with Ethan, the way that you feel is going to depend, at least in great part, as to what's going through your mind?  29 \n \nAbe:  \nI think there's truth to that.  \nJudith:  \nYes. For example, when you thought, \"I'll never get better ,\" what effect did that \nhave on your mood?  \nAbe:  \nIt just made me depressed. Made me want to give up.  \n \n[Dr. Beck recognizes that it’s likely Abe will have this automatic thought again, \nso she prepares him for it. ] \nJudith:  \nExactly. If you have that thought again, \"I'll never get better,\" how would you like \nto answer that thought?  \n \n[Dr. Beck doesn’t need to use Socratic questioning, because Abe has already \nrecognized there is evidence that he is starting to get better. But sh e doesn’t \nsupply him with an answer, either. The response will be more powerful if Abe \nhimself states it. ] \nAbe:  \nWell, I guess the first thing is, that's not a sure thing, that I'll never get better anymore.  \nJudith:  \nRight. That's excellent. [writing] “ That's not a sure thing. ” What makes you think \nthat it might not be true?  \nAbe:  \nBecause when I do stuff, I feel better.  \nJudith:  \nExactly. So, you've really started to prove that to yourself, then.  30 \n \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nSo [writing] , \"I've started to prove this to myself.\" What was the other thought? \n“This isn't going to work ?” \nAbe:  \nThis isn't going to work. That therapy isn't going to work.  \nJudith:  \nWhat would you like to remind yourself about that?  \nAbe:  \nWell, I don't want to jinx it, but it seems like , a little bit, it already is.  \nJudith:  \nSo [writing],  \"It seems, a little bit, that it already is.\" That's good. All right. I got \nthat on your Action Plan  for you.  \nAbe:  \nOkay.  \n \n[Next, Dr. Beck provides additional psychoeducation. ] \nJudith:  \nNow, we call these kinds of thoughts, these thoughts that just seem to pop up \ninto your mind, we call them automatic thoughts.  \n \n[Dr. Beck recognizes that many people who are depressed criticize themselves \nfor having negative automatic thoughts. ] \n \nIt's not  your fault  that you're having them. The reason that you're having these \nreally negative automatic thoughts is because you're depressed. So, we've been \ntalking about that.  31 \n \nAbe:  \nOkay. Yeah.  \n[Dr. Beck asks Abe about continuing an Action Plan.]  \nJudith:  \nSo, this week, you're going to use the rubber band again to try to keep on \nidentifying those thoughts ? \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nAnd to keep on reminding yourself that just because you think them, doesn't \nnecessarily mean that it's true ? And here I've written down answers to a couple of \nthe automatic thoughts that you had this past week that you might have this coming week.  \nAbe:  \nOkay.  \nJudith:  \n[reading ] If I think I'll never get better, remind myself that's not a sure thing. I've \nstarted to prove this to myself. And “ This isn't going to work. ” If I think that, \nremind myself it seems, a little bit, that it already is.\" Good.  \nAbe:  \nI think that might help.  \n \nWORKING ON GOAL  #1 [Part 1 ] \n[Dr Beck addresses Abe’s goal t o make his evenings better  in two parts . First, \nshe asks if he could incorporate family into his evenings. She motivates him to \nwork toward this goal by calling attention to his core value of family. They \nidentify a step Abe wants to take in the coming week toward his goal. Dr. Beck \nconceptualize s an automatic thought that might be an obstacle and uses 32 \n \n[Socratic questioning to help Abe respond to it. Then they set a specific Action \nPlan  and she writes it down for Abe .] \n Judith:  \nNow, before we get to evenings , you said earlier today that being with the family \nis really important to you.  \n \n[At their first session, Abe had identified family as one of his core values. Dr. \nBeck also recognizes that Abe has become disconnected from almost everyone. \nAnd regaining a sense of connection is important for most individuals with \ndepression.  So, she weaves family into their discussion of how to make his \nevenings better.  She starts by giving him a choice. ] \n \nI wonder if there's something that you could do in the evenings ? Either being with \nyour family or talking to them on the phone ? What would you like to be able to \ndo?  \n \n[The next question Dr. Beck asks is really key. ] \n If you weren't  depressed, what would you do?  \nAbe:  \nWell, I'd like to go over, but I don't want to invite myself . \n \n[Dr. Beck notes that Abe has probably had an automatic thought that leads him \nto feel r eluctant to invite himself to their house . She recognizes that, i f he’s \nwilling, having face -to-face contact with them wi ll strengthen his sense of \nconnection much more than a phone call.  After specifying whom Abe will call, \nshe addresses the automatic thought. ] \n But I could call them and talk to them on the phone. Oftentimes, when I call, they \ninvite me over.  \nJudith:  33 \n \nOkay. So, you're going to talk on the phone to whom?  \nAbe:  \nMy son and my daughter.  \nJudith:  \nGreat.  \nAbe:  \nI could give them a call.  \nJudith:  \nUh-huh [nods “yes’] . So, do you have some thought that gets in the way of your \nsaying, \"Hey, is it convenient for me to come over?\"  \nAbe:  \nI don't want to impose.  \nJudith:  \nSo, the thought is, \"If I invite myself, I'll be imposing on them.\" Is that right?  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \n\"I'll be imposing on them.\"  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nIf we can take a moment here to try to figure out whether that thought is 100  \npercent  true, or zero percent  true, or someplace in the middle. I don't know. It \nmight be 100  percent  true.  \n 34 \n \n[Dr. Beck now starts the process of Socratic questioning to evaluate the \nthought. ] \n \nBut what makes you think that they'll see it as an imposition?  \n \n[In other words, what evidence does Abe have? ] \nAbe:  \nI don't know if they will. I just think it.  \nJudith:  \nI see. \nAbe:  \nI just think of myself that way.  \n \n[Dr. Beck seeks evidence from the past]  \nJudith:  \nBefore you got depressed, did you ever invite yourself over?  \nAbe:  \nYeah. “Can I come over and spend some time with the kids? ” Yeah.  \nJudith:  \nDid they seem to have a negative attitude about your doing that?  \nAbe:  \nNo, not at all. They always seemed happy to have me come over.  \nJudith:  \nI see. Were there any times when you invited yourself over where they said, \"Gee, \ntoday isn't a really good time\"?  \nAbe:  35 \n \nInstead of s aying, \"It's not a good time,\" they'd say something like, \"Tomorrow \nwould be better because we've got something scheduled today.\"  \nJudith:  \nSomething scheduled. Right. So, if I could summarize what you just said, in the \npast, when you've invited yourself ove r, they've been glad to see you. And it \nsounds like they've been honest if it would be an imposition on them.  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nSo, have they changed in some way, do you think, that they wouldn't want you to \ncome over now?  \nAbe:  \nNo. I think it's just I've changed my thinking, the way I think about my... When I get into that spiral, I start thinking that stuff, and then, I guess, it's stuff I just make up.  \n \n[Dr. Beck offers another perspective and ask Abe what he thinks. ] \nJudith:  \nI wonder if another way  of looking at this is that maybe they would do exactly \nwhat they've done in the past, which is either to welcome you, or to reschedule? Do you think that's possible?  \nAbe:  \nYeah. I think so.  \nJudith:  \nYeah.  \n \n[Dr. Beck de -catastrophizes the situation by  having Abe think of how he could \ncope with the worst outcome and then what the best and most realistic \noutcomes probably are. ] 36 \n \n \nAnd if the worst happens, and they say, \"Gee, sorry, but we're really busy now,\" \nthen how could you cope with that?  \nAbe:  \nI could call the other one.  \nJudith:  \nThat's a great idea. Right. But that's only the worst that could happen. What's the best that could happen if you called one of them?  \nAbe:  \nThey'd say, \"Sure, we'd love to have you over. When would you like to come?\"  \nJudith:  \nYeah, that sounds pretty good. What do you think is the most realistic  outcome?  \nAbe:  \nThey'd probably say something like, \"Yeah, that'd be great. We'd be happy to have you over. Thursday night would be a good time. Can you come over then?\"  \nJudith:  \nSo, the  most realistic is that they'd be really glad that you called.  \nAbe:  \nI think so. \nJudith:  \nAnd they'd set a date with you.  \nAbe:  \nThey were always good, in the past, about those kinds of things. It's just since I \nstarted going downhill, it was more like me not calling them. Not them saying \nthey didn't want to see me.  \n 37 \n \n[Again, Dr. Beck asks Abe to take an active part in crafting a response instead of \nproviding him with one.]  \nJudith:  \nRight. So, how do you want to answer this thought, \"If I invite myself, I'll be \nimposing on them\"?  \nAbe:  \nWell, in the past, they've always been happy to hear from me.  \nJudith:  \nYeah. So  [writing] , \"In the past, they were always happy to hear from me.\" That's \ngood.  \n \n[Dr. Beck asks Abe to set a specific Action Plan ] \n \nWould you like to set yourself an Action Plan  item about this?  \nAbe:  \nI should call one of them anyway, if not both.  \nJudith:  \nWhat do you think, one or both?  \nAbe:  \nHow about one, with other one being optional?  \nJudith:  \nThat sounds good. Okay, so are going to ca ll your son or the daughter? Which \none's going to be optional?  \nAbe:  \nMy daughter will be optional.  \nJudith:  38 \n \nOkay. So, do you think it might be a good idea for you to call them and try to go \nover one evening , since evenings are so tough for you?  \nAbe:  \nYeah, that would be really good if I could do that.  \nJudith:  \nYes. [writing]  Then, optionally, you'd call the other one and see if you could go \nover one evening.  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \n \nWORKING ON GOAL #1 [ Part 2]  \n \n[Next, Dr. Beck and Abe continue to talk about the goal of making evenings \nbetter. ] \nJudith:  \nWhat else would you like to be able to do in the evenings?  \nAbe:  \nWell, the grandkids, they have different kinds of activities going on. I could go to something. I could go to a game, or a concert . This is sort of the end of the school \nyear for them. They've got different kinds of things going on at school that I could \ngo to. \nJudith:  \nThat sounds great. That's great. And on the evenings when you stay in your \napartment , what would you like to be doing?  \nAbe:  \nWell, even if I could read the paper and concentrate on it, that would be an improvement.  \nJudith:  39 \n \nOkay. So, another thing is you might read the newspaper.  \nAbe:  \nLike read the entire sports section. That would be an im provement.  \nJudith:  \nOkay.  \nAbe:  \nI used to like politics, but that's getting harder, so I don't know if I want to do that \nnow.  \nJudith:  \nOkay.  \n \n[Dr. Beck wants to make sure that Abe will be able to successfully complete the \nAction Plan. Up to this point, he has been able to read a short part of the sports \nsection but not the whole thing. ] \n \nI think we should make the  entire  sports section optional, but at least you'd read \npart of it.  \nAbe:  \nPart of it.  \nJudith:  \nIs that all right?  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \n[writes it down]  \n  40 \n \n \nWORKING ON GOAL #2  \n[Dr Beck addresses Abe’s second goal, to straighten up his apartment. First,  she \nasks him what steps he’d like to take. She makes sure that the steps are small so \nhe won’t be overwhelmed and checks on the likelihood of completion . She also \nemphasizes another core value Abe has: being in control.  Dr. Beck \nconceptualizes that an au tomatic thought might be an obstacle and uses \nSocratic questioning to help Abe respond to it. Then they set a specific Action \nPlan and she writes it down for Abe. ] \n \nJudith:  \n You mentioned getting your apartment in better order. Is there something you'd \nlike to do during the day, or the evening about that?  \nAbe:  \nI should probably clean up the kitchen. I'd just get the dirty stuff out of the sink \nand put it away.  \nJudith:  \nSo, \"Cl eaning the kitchen.\" But not the whole kitchen, right?  \nAbe:  \nYeah, not the whole kitchen. I would clean the sink.  \nJudith:  \n[writing] You said , “Just clean the sink. ” Okay, that sounds good.  \nAbe:  \nWhich would be, by itself, a big improvement.  \nJudith:  \nYeah.  \n 41 \n \n[Dr. Beck then asks the most important question to assess the likelihood that \nAbe will take this step. ] \n \nSo, how likely are you to clean the sink?  \nAbe:  \nPart of it, for sure.  \nJudith:  \nDo you want to maybe set a time limit on it? Like clean the sink for 10 mi nutes, \nand then you can stop?  \nAbe:  \nThat would be good.  \nJudith:  \nOkay.  \nAbe:  \nThat way I could do that and be okay with putting the 10 minutes in.  \nJudith:  \nIs there something else you'd like to do this week? Something that, around the \napartment, that if you did it, you could say, \"Okay, this shows I'm starting to take \ncontrol. Starting to take control of the apartment,\" like doing some of the dishes.  \n \n[Dr. B eck emphasizes the importance of Abe’s regaining a sense of control, \nanother one of his core values. ] \nWhat else would make a difference to you?  \nAbe:  \nProbably clean the bathroom.  \nJudith:  \nThat sounds like a big job.  42 \n \nAbe:  \nWell, maybe just the sink.  \nJudith:  \nOkay  [writing]  \"Clean the bathroom sink.\" Is this enough, or should we give you \none more thing to do?  \nAbe:  \nIt's starting to sound like a lot.  \n \n[Dr. Beck realizes Abe is starting to feel overwhelmed so she  next reviews the \nAction Plan , offering to change it if Abe wants. ] \n \nREVIEWING THE NEW ACTION PLAN  \n[Dr. Beck reads through the entire Action Plan, which contains steps Abe has \nagreed to take toward both goals and also therapy notes, important things for \nhim to remember. ] \nJudith:  \nAll right. So, let me go through, if this is okay, the Action Plan  that we have so far, \nand then let's cross some things off, or make some things easier. Okay?  \nAbe:  \nOkay.  \nJudith:  \nAll right. So, when you do anything that's even a little bit difficult, you're going to \ngive yourself credit.  \nAbe:  \nOkay.  \nJudith:  \nAnd you're goi ng to write it on a piece of paper. You've already started here.  43 \n \nAbe:  \nI've got my rubber band as a reminder to do that.  \nJudith:  \nYes. [writing]  I'm going to put down rubber band. Right. And we wrote down that \nthe reason to do this is that it will build your confidence.  \nAbe:  \nYeah. Yeah.  \nJudith:  \nThis is something you're going to do at night, but you're going to keep the rubber \nband, and at least tr y to keep track of these things during the day also.  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nOkay. \"Get out of the house four to six times.\" How does that sound?  \nAbe:  \nYeah. I can do that.  \nJudith:  \nOkay. How much do you agree with this idea? \"I can do things I thought I couldn't \ndo.\" How true do you think that is?  \nAbe:  \nWell, little things anyway, that's true.  \nJudith:  \nMm-hmm [nods “yes’]  It's true. Good. \nAbe:  \nI mean, I've already done that, a little bit.  \nJudith:  44 \n \nSo, I'm writing true next to that. \"When I do them, I feel good about them.\"  \nAbe:  \nYeah. I agree with that.  \nJudith:  \nThat's true. \"Maybe this means there are things I can do to take control.\"  \nAbe:  \nI believe that  50 percent . \nJudith:  \nOkay. Maybe we'll come back to that if we have time. \"If I think I'll never get \nbetter, remind myself that not getting better is not a sure thing. I've started to \nprove this to myself.\"  \nAbe:  \nI've started doing things, and when I do those things, I feel better. So, that's kind of proof that doing things could help.  \nJudith:  \nAll right. A nd, \"When you think this isn't going to work, remind myself it seems, a \nlittle bit, that it already is .”  Do you believe that?  \nAbe:  \nThat's true. Yeah, because I do feel better . \nJudith:  \nNow, could you read these therapy notes every morning?  \nAbe:  \nMm-hmm [nods “yes’]  \nJudith:  \nYou want to keep them by the coffee maker like the other ones? Could you read \nthe other notes , too? The ones from last week, and the ones from the week \nbefore?  45 \n \nAbe:  \nYeah, I got those. \nJudith:  \nOkay. So, I'll write that here. [wri ting] \"Read all the therapy notes  in the morning .\" \nI think they probably are all still relevant to you. I do think it would help to read \nthem later on in the day. Would you be willing to try to do that?  \nAbe:  \nYeah. I'm just trying to think when would be the  time to do it. I've said I'd do a \ncouple things in the evenings on the couch, and I'm afraid to overload the evening \nto have too many things on the list at the end of the day.  \nJudith:  \nHow long do you think it will take you to read the notes?  \nAbe:  \nFive min utes.  \nJudith:  \nNo, I don't think so. I think it will probably take a minute and a half. If we had \ntime, I'd have you read them right now and we could time you. But that's fine. If you'd like to read it in the afternoon, that's fine. What would you think about \nsetting a timer on your phone? That's what I do all the time.  \nAbe:  \nI think maybe when I eat my dinner . \nJudith:  \nGreat. All right. So, how are you going to remind yourself? Do you want a note in \nthe kitchen?  \nAbe:  \nI'll just make this a multipurpos e rubber band.  \nJudith:  46 \n \nOkay. [writing] So when you notice the rubber band at dinner, you'll say, \"Read \nthe notes.\" Okay, so notice the rubber band to remind you.  \nAbe:  \nOkay. It helps me to write it down too.  \nJudith:  \nGood. I'm going to give you a copy of this , too. \nAbe:  \nThank you.  \nJudith:  \nSo, then you'll have two copies. I want to make sure that these things don't sound \noverwhelming. \"Talk on the phone to your son and daughter. To your son, and \nthen talking to your daughter is optional.\"  \nAbe:  \nYeah. I'll call him. I'll call him.  \nJudith:  \nAnd invite yourself over?  \nAbe:  \nCan we make that optional?  \nJudith:  \nYes. Let's do that.  \nAbe:  \nI'll call him, but...  \nJudith:  \n[writing] \"Inviting self over is optional.\" And I did put a note on here. \"In the past, \nthey were  always happy to hear from me.\"  \nAbe:  47 \n \nThat's true.  If you could just draw a line from that over to making the phone call . \nJudith:  \nThat's good. In the evenings, we talked about trying to go to a game, or a concert, \nsomething that your grandchildren are involved in.  \nAbe:  \nOr even during the day because  they have things during the day at school.  \nJudith:  \nOh, that's good.  So, day or evening.  \nAbe:  \nOr things in the late afternoon.  \nJudith:  \nDo you want to keep that on, or you want to make that optional?  \nAbe:  \nI'd like to do that.  \nJudith:  \nOkay. \"In the evening, read the newspaper. If you can, even the entire sports \nsection.\" Want to keep that on?  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nOkay. Then, I think these things were for the day, but I'm not sure. One was, \"Clean the kitchen sink for 10 minutes.\"  \nAbe:  \nI think that was in the evening that I wanted to do that because that would give me something to do instead of just sitting on the couch.  \nJudith:  48 \n \nGot it. So, how likely are you to do that one evening?  \nAbe:  \nOne evening?  \nJudith:  \nMm-hmm [nods “yes’].  For 10 minutes.  \nAbe:  \nI'll do that.  \nJudith:  \nAnd cleaning the bathroom sink?  \nAbe:  \nLess so.  \nJudith:  \nOptional?  \n \n[It’s much better for the client’s confidence and sense of control to make an \nAction Plan easier or optional if it doesn’t look highly likely that the client will \ndo it. ] \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nOkay. So, there's a lot on the sheet, but most of it is just reading things to \nyours elf. So  [reading from Action Plan notes], the stuff we actually have you doing \nis giving yourself credit, getting out of the house four to six times, reading your therapy notes, talking on the phone to your son,  going to a game or to a concert \nor something with your grandchildren.  \nAbe:  \nLooking at some kind of school activity.  49 \n \nJudith:  \nOkay. Reading the newspaper, at least once. And then cleaning the kitchen sink. \nHow hard will it be to give yourself credit?  \nAbe:  \nI think I can do that.  \n \n[Dr. Beck wants to reinforce the rationale for keeping a credit list, so she elicits \nit instead of providing it. ] \n \nJudith:  \nRemind me what the point is of giving yourself credit.  \nAbe:  \nWell, I recognize then that I'm doing something, even though I have depres sion.  \nJudith:  \nYeah.  \nAbe:  \nAnd that, by doing these things, it gives me a way to take control over that.  \nJudith:  \nExactly. And then what happens to your confidence in yourself?  \nAbe:  \nBetter.  \nJudith:  \nIt gets better, right. So, you think you can give yourself credit ? Do you think you \ncan get out of the house four to six times?  \nAbe:  \nMm-hmm [nods “yes’]. , I can do that.  \n 50 \n \n[Rather than telling Abe she thinks getting out of the house will be easier this \nweek, Dr. Beck asks him a question so he can draw that conclusion himself. ] \nJudith:  \nDo you think it's going to be easier this week to get out of the house at least four \ntimes, or harder?  \nAbe:  \nYeah, I liked doing that.  \n \n[She asks additional questions to help him realize that other tasks won’t be too \ndifficult. ] \nJudith:  \nOkay, so it sounds like that . Reading the therapy notes. How hard will that be?  \nAbe:  \nThat won't be hard.  \nJudith:  \nOkay. Talking to your son on the phone. How hard will that be?  \nAbe:  \nAfter I call him, it'll be fine. He'll be happy to hear from me. It's just dialing the \nnumber that's going to be the hard part.  \nJudith:  \nYeah.  \n \n[Again, Dr. Beck elicits the rationale for doing something that is difficult. ] \n \nSo, is there something you want to remind yourself of? Why do something that's \nhard? Why call your son?  \nAbe:  \nBecause they've always been happy to hear from me before.  51 \n \nJudith:  \nYeah. Any other reasons to call your son?  \nAbe:  \nFamily. Connections. Just a bunch of stuff.  \n \n[Dr. Beck offers an additional rationale. ] \nJudith:  \nDo you think your son might feel good if you called him?  \nAbe:  \nHe'd probably be happy to hear from me.  \nJudith:  \nYeah. So, it would help you, and it would probably make your son feel good. \nWhen you realize that, does it make it harder to do, or easier to do?  \nAbe:  \nEasier b ecause I think they're worried about me, and if they hear from me, they'll \nfeel better.  \nJudith:  \nExactly. How hard will it be to read the newspaper?  \nAbe:  \nWell, that shouldn't be hard as long as I can concentrate on it.  \nJudith:  \nRight. Going to at least one e vent that your grandchildren are involved with.  \nAbe:  \nI can do that . I just know that towards the end of the school year, they do stuff.  \nJudith:  52 \n \nYeah. So, maybe we'll just put  [writing] , \"If it works out.\" That's good. Cleaning \nthe sink for 10 minutes. How hard is that going to be?  \nAbe:  \nI think making it for 10 minutes makes it easier. If I think I have to clean up the \nsink, that would be really hard.  \nJudith:  \nYou can do 10 minutes ? \nAbe:  \nI can do that.  \nJudith:  \nThat's good. Reading all your therapy notes, not just this week, but from last week \nand the week before. Do you think you can do that?  \nAbe:  \nI can do that over dinner.  \nJudith:  \nGreat. Well, Abe, I think you've got a great Action Plan  here.  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \n \n[Dr. Beck points out the progress he’s making. ] \nJudith:  \nEven if you could only do half of it, it would be so much better than you were \ndoing three weeks ago, wouldn't it?  \nAbe:  \nIt's a lot more.  \nJudith:  53 \n \nYeah. I think if you're able to not only do it, but give yourself credit, my gue ss is \nyou're pretty soon going to really notice small changes in your mood.  \nAbe:  \nI notice the change in my mood when I'm doing stuff.  \nJudith:  \nYeah. That's great that you can see that.  \n \nELICITING FEEDBACK AT END OF SESSION  \n \n[Next, Dr. Beck elicits feedback and takes the opportunity to provide a dditional \npsychoeducation and a behavioral guideline linked to Abe’s values. ] \n \nJudith:  \nSo, what  did you think of today's session?  \nAbe:  \nIt's good. I start thinking, \"Well, maybe this will work,\" because these are all \nthings that I want to do.  \nJudith:  \nYeah.  \n \n[Dr. Beck reinforces the metaphor that explains why Abe has been having so \nmany negative automatic thoughts. ] \n \nBut it's been really hard because of those black glasses, I think.  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nDon't you think that those thoughts have really gotten in the way?  54 \n \nAbe:  \nYeah. I want to do them. And I think that if I do them, I think that things will go \nbetter.  \nJudith:  \nI think so , too.  \n \n[Abe is feeling better  but Dr. Beck wants to let him know that his mood will \nvary , so he won’t get overly discouraged when it does and so she can make a \nrecommendation of what to do. ] \n \nNow, of course, you're going to have your ups and downs this week.  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nSo, there are probably going to be times when you're more depressed. But when \nyou are feeling more depressed, the best thing to do is just to get up off the \ncouch. Anything that you do, other than sitting on the couch thinking depressing \nthoughts, is better th an that. Anything that you do.  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \n \n[Next, Dr. Beck provides additional psychoeducation, linking the guideline to \nAbe’s value of being in c ontrol. ] \nJudith:  \nThe whole thing with depression is depression saps motivation. It makes you just want to sit on the couch. What's really important is not to do what you feel  like \ndoing when you're depressed, because all you feel like doing is sitting on the \ncouch. What's really important to do is the things that will help you take better control. So, not what you feel like doing, but the things that will help you feel \nmore in control. Should I write that down too?  55 \n \nAbe:  \nYou can. I've got it, but you can, yeah.  \nJudith:  \nYou g ot it. Yeah, well, I'll put it here so I'll know it for my notes too.  \nAbe:  \nOkay.  \nJudith:  \nSo, (writing) \"Not what you feel like doing, but what will help you feel in control.\" \nThat's good. Was there anything I said today that bothered you, or you thought I \ngot wrong?  \nAbe:  \nNo. No. It was real helpful.  \nJudith:  \nAnd how about when you come in next time, anything you want to do differently?  \nAbe:  \nNo. I think that if we just keep doing this , I'm hoping it will work.  \n \n[Dr. Beck boosts Abe’s confidence by expressing her genuine agreement.]  \nJudith:  \nI think it's going to work. I really do. See you next time.  \nAbe:  \nOkay.  \nJudith:  \nNext week, same time.  \nAbe:  \nMm-hmm [nods “yes’ ]. 56 \n \nJudith:  \nGreat.  \nAbe:  \nOkay. Thanks.  ",

Okay, we'll do that.  \n \nREINFORCING THE COGNITIVE MODEL  \n \nJudith:  \nSo, you were able to catch some of these depressed thoughts this week, right?  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nSo, what do you think of this idea that the way tha",
            "t you feel, say, for example, as you're taking a walk, or as you're with Ethan, the way that you feel is going to depend, at least in great part, as to what's going through your mind?  29 \n \nAbe:  \nI think there's truth to that.  \nJudith:  \nYes. For example, when you thought, \"I'll never get better ,\" what effect did that \nhave on your mood?  \nAbe:  \nIt just made me depressed. Made me want to give up.  \n \n[Dr. Beck recognizes that it’s likely Abe will have this automatic thought again, \nso she p",

[writing] “ That's not a sure thing. ” What makes you think \nthat it might not be true?  \nAbe:  \nBecause when I do stuff, I feel better.  \nJudith:  \nExactly. So, you've really started to prove that to yourself, then.  30 \n \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nSo [writing] , \"I've started to prove this to myself.\" What was the other thought? \n“This isn't going to work ?” \nAbe:  \nThis isn't going to work. That therapy isn't going to work.  \nJudith:  \nWhat would yo",

All right. I got \nthat on your Action Plan  for you.  \nAbe:  \nOkay.  \n \n[Next, Dr. Beck provides additional psychoeducation. ] \nJudith:  \nNow, we call these kinds of thoughts, these thoughts that just seem to pop up \ninto your mind, we call them automatic thoughts.  \n \n[Dr. Beck recogni",

The reason that you're having these \nreally negative automatic thoughts is because you're depressed. So, we've been \ntalking about that.  31 \n \nAbe:  \nOkay. Yeah.  \n[Dr. Beck asks Abe about continuing an Action Plan.]  \nJudith:  \nSo, this week, you're going to use the rubber band again to try to keep on \nidentifying those thoughts ? \nAbe:  \nYeah",

Dr. \nBeck also recognizes that Abe has become disconnected from almost everyone. \nAnd regaining a sense of connection is important for most individuals with \ndepression.  ",
            "So, she weaves family into their discussion of how to make his \nevenings better.  She starts by giving him a choice. ] \n \nI wonder if there's something that you could do in the evenings ? Either being with \nyour family or talking to them on the phone ? What would you like to be able to \ndo?  \n \n[The next question Dr. Beck asks is really key. ] \n If you weren't  depressed, what would you do?  \nAbe:  \nWell, I'd like to go over, but I don't want to invite myself . \n \n[Dr. Beck notes that Abe has pr",
            "obably had an automatic thought that leads him \nto feel r eluctant to invite himself to their house . She recognizes that, i f he’s \nwilling, having face -to-face contact with them wi ll strengthen his sense of \nconnection much more than a phone call.  After specifying whom Abe will call, \nshe addresses the automatic thought. ] \n But I could call them and talk to them on the phone. Oftentimes, when I call, they \ninvite me over.  \nJudith:  33 \n \nOkay. So, you're going to talk on the phone to whom",
            "?  \nAbe:  \nMy son and my daughter.  \nJudith:  \nGreat.  \nAbe:  \nI could give them a call.  \nJudith:  \nUh-huh [nods “yes’] . So, do you have some thought that gets in the way of your \nsaying, \"Hey, is it convenient for me to come over?\"  \nAbe:  \nI don't want to impose.  \nJudith:  \nSo, the thought is, \"If I invite myself, I'll be imposing on them.\" Is that right?  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \n\"I'll be imposing on them.\"  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nIf we can take a moment here to try to figure out wheth",

I just think it.  \nJudith:  \nI see. \nAbe:  \nI just think of myself that way.  \n \n[Dr. Beck seeks evidence from the ",
            "past]  \nJudith:  \nBefore you got depressed, did you ever invite yourself over?  \nAbe:  \nYeah. “Can I come over and spend some time with the kids? ” Yeah.  \nJudith:  \nDid they seem to have a negative attitude about your doing that?  \nAbe:  \nNo, not at all. They always seemed happy to have me come over.  \nJudith:  \nI see. Were there any times when you invited yourself over where they said, \"Gee, \ntoday isn't a really good time\"?  \nAbe:  35 \n \nInstead of s aying, \"It's not a good time,\" they'd say ",
            "something like, \"Tomorrow \nwould be better because we've got something scheduled today.\"  \nJudith:  \nSomething scheduled. Right. So, if I could summarize what you just said, in the \npast, when you've invited yourself ove r, they've been glad to see you. And it \nsounds like they've been honest if it would be an imposition on them.  \nAbe:  \nYeah.  \nJudith:  \nSo, have they changed in some way, do you think, that they wouldn't want you to \ncome over now?  \nAbe:  \nNo. I think it's just I've changed m",
            "y thinking, the way I think about my... When I get into that spiral, I start thinking that stuff, and then, I guess, it's stuff I just make up.  \n \n[Dr. Beck offers another perspective and ask Abe what he thinks. ] \nJudith:  \nI wonder if another way  of looking at this is that maybe they would do exactly \nwhat they've done in the past, which is either to welcome you, or to reschedule? Do you think that's possible?  \nAbe:  \nYeah. I think so.  \nJudith:  \nYeah.  \n \n[Dr. Beck de -catastrophizes the ",
            "situation by  having Abe think of how he could \ncope with the worst outcome and then what the best and most realistic \noutcomes probably are. ] 36 \n \n \nAnd if the worst happens, and they say, \"Gee, sorry, but we're really busy now,\" \nthen how could you cope with that?  \nAbe:  \nI could call the other one.  \nJudith:  \nThat's a great idea. Right. But that's only the worst that could happen. What's the best that could happen if you called one of them?  \nAbe:  \nThey'd say, \"Sure, we'd love to have yo",
            "u over. When would you like to come?\"  \nJudith:  \nYeah, that sounds pretty good. What do you think is the most realistic  outcome?  \nAbe:  \nThey'd probably say something like, \"Yeah, that'd be great. We'd be happy to have you over. Thursday night would be a good time. Can you come over then?\"  \nJudith:  \nSo, the  most realistic is that they'd be really glad that you called.  \nAbe:  \nI think so. \nJudith:  \nAnd they'd set a date with you.  \nAbe:  \nThey were always good, in the past, about those ki",
            "nds of things. It's just since I \nstarted going downhill, it was more like me not calling them. Not them saying \nthey didn't want to see me.  \n 37 \n \n[Again, Dr. Beck asks Abe to take an active part in crafting a response instead of \nproviding him with one.]  \nJudith:  \nRight. So, how do you want to answer this thought, \"If I invite myself, I'll be \nimposing on them\"?  \nAbe:  \nWell, in the past, they've always been happy to hear from me.  \nJudith:  \nYeah. So  [writing] , \"In the past, they were ",

Three approaches to psychotherapy  (Part I)[Film]. Orange,  \nCA: Psychological Films.]      \nGLORIA\nDR. CARL ROGERS PART I -- DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM\n[Before the Interview]\n\"From my own years of therapeutic experience, I have come to feel that if I can \ncreate the proper climate, the proper, relationship, the proper conditions, a process of \ntherapeutic movement will almost inevitably occur in my client. You may ask, 'What is \nthis climate? What are these conditions? Will they exist in the interview with the woman \nI am about to talk with, whom I have never seen before?' Let me try to describe very \nbriefly what these conditions are as I see them.\nFirst of all, one question is, can I be real in the relationship? This has come to \nhave an increasing amount of importance to me over the years. I feel that genuineness is \nanother way of describing the quality I would like to have. I like the term 'congruent', by \nwhich. I mean that what I am experiencing inside is present in my awareness and comes \nout through my communication. In a sense, when I have this quality, I am all in one piece  \nin the relationship. There is another word that describes it for me. I feel that in the \nrelationship, I would like to have a 'transparency.' I would be quite willing for my client \nto see all the way through me, that there would be nothing hidden. And when lam real in \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria, Introduction, page 2this fashion that I'm trying to describe, then know that my own feelings will often bubble \nup into awareness and be expressed, but be expressed in ways that won't impose \nthemselves on my client.\nThen the second question I would have is, will I find myself prizing this person, \ncaring for this person? I certainly don't want to pretend a if I dislike my client \npersistently, I feel it is better, that I should express it. But I know that the process of \ntherapy is much more likely to occur and constructive change is much more likely, if I \nfeel a real spontaneous prizing of this individual with whom I'm working, a prizing of \nthis person as a separate individual. You can call that quality acceptance, you can call it \ncaring, you can call it a non-possessive love if you wish. I think any of those terms tend \nto describe it. I know that the relationship will prove more constructive if it's present.\nThen the third quality, will I be able to understand the inner world of this \nindividual from the inside? Will I be able to see it through her eyes? Will I be able to be \nsufficiently sensitive to move around inside the world of her feelings so that I know what \nit feels like to be her so that I can sense not only the surface meanings, but some of the \nmeanings that lie somewhat underneath the surface. I know that if I can let myself \nsensitively and accurately enter into her world of experience, then change and therapeutic  \nmovement are much more likely.\nWell, suppose I am fortunate and that I do experience some of these attitudes in \nthe relationship, what then? Well, then a variety of things are likely to happen. Both from  \nmy clinical experience and from our research investigations we find that if attitudes of the  \nsorts that I have described are present, then quite a number of things will happen. She'll \nexplore some of her feelings and attitudes more deeply. She is likely to discover some \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria, Introduction, page 3hidden aspects of herself that she wasn't aware of previously. Feeling herself prized by \nme, it is quite possible she'll come to prize herself more. Feeling that some of her \nmeanings are understood by me, then she can more readily perhaps listen to herself, listen  \nto what is going on within her own experience, listen to some of the meanings she hasn't \nbeen able to catch before. And perhaps if she senses realness in me, she'll be able to be a \nlittle more real within herself. I suspect there will be a change in the manner of her \nexpression, at least this has been my experience in other instances. From being rather \nremote from her experiencing, remote from\nwhat is going on within her, it's possible that she'll move toward more immediacy of \nexperiencing, that she will be able to sense and explore what is going on in her in the \nimmediate moment. From being disapproving of herself, it is quite possible she'll move \ntoward a greater degree of acceptance of herself. From somewhat of a fear of relating, she  \nmay move toward being able to relate more directly and to encounter me more directly. \nFrom construing life in somewhat rigid black and white patterns,' she may move toward \nmore tentative ways of construing her experience and of seeing meanings in it. From a \nlocus of evaluation which is outside of herself, it is quite possible she will move toward \nrecognizing a greater capacity within herself for making judgments and drawing \nconclusions. So those are some of the changes that we have tended to find and I think that  \nthey are all of them changes that are characteristic of the process of therapy or of \ntherapeutic movement. If I have any success in creating the kind of conditions that I \ndescribed initially, then we may be able to see some of these changes in this client even \nthough I know in advance that our contact is going to be very brief.\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria, Introduction, page 4This transcript is available for purposes of research, study and teaching.

Good morning. (C: Hello, Dr. Rogers)  I'm Dr.  \nRogers, you must be Gloria. (They shake hands and sit down.)\nC2Yes, I am.\nT2Won't you have a chair?  Now then, we have half an hour together , and I really don't \nknow what we will be able to make of it but uh I hope we can make something of it.  \nI'd be glad to know whatever concerns you. (T: Sitting forward, C: Sitting back, legs  \ncrossed, right arm over the back of the chair)\nC3Well, right now I'm nervous (T: Mhm)  but I feel more comfortable the way you are  \ntalking in a low voice and I don't feel like you'll be so harsh on me.  But, ah ...\nT3I hear the tremor in your voice so I know you are...  (C: Smiles)\nC4Uh, well, the main thing I um, want to talk to you about is uh, I'm just newly  \ndivorced and uh I had gone in therapy before and I felt comfortable when I left, and  \nall of a sudden now the biggest change is adjusting to my single life.  (T: Mhm,  \nmhm) And uh one of the things that bothers me the most is especially men, and  \nhaving men to the house and how it affects the children (T: Mhm, Mhm) and-   Uh,  \nthe biggest thing I want - the thing that keeps coming to my mind I want to tell you  \nabout is that I have a daughter, nine, who at one time I felt had a lot of emotional  \nproblems.  I wish I could stop shaking (T and C: laugh).  And uh, I'm real conscious  \nof things affecting her. I don't want her to get upset, I don't want to shock her.  I want  \nso bad to-  for her to accept me.  And we're real open with each other especially  \nabout sex.  And the other day she saw a girl that was single but pregnant and she  \nasked me all about \"can girls get pregnant if they are single?\"  And the conversation  \nwas fine and I wasn’t un- at ease at all with her until she asked me if I had ever made  \nlove to a man since I left her daddy and I lied to her.  And ever since that, it keeps  \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Interview, page 5coming up to my mind because I feel so guilty lying to her because I never lie and I  \nwant her to trust me.  And I want- I almost want an answer from you.  I want you to  \ntell me if it would affect her wrong if I told her the truth, or what. (T:Mhm)\nT4And it's this concern about her and the fact that you really aren't  - that this open \nrelationship that has existed between you, now you feel it's kind of vanished?  \nC5Yes.  I feel like I have to be on guard about that (T: Mhm) because I remember when  \nI was a little girl, when I first found out my mother and father made love, that was  \ndirty and terrible, and I didn't- I didn’t like her any more for awhile.  And I don't  \nwant to lie to Pammy either and I don't know...\nT5I sure wish I could give you the answer as to what you should tell her.  (Smiles.)\nC6I was afraid you were going to say that  (Laughs).\nT6Because what you really want is an answer. \nC7I want to especially know if it would affect her if I was completely honest and open  \nwith her or if it would affect her because I lied.  I feel like it is bound to make a  \nstrain because I lied to her. [Words lost]\nT7Mhm. You feel she'll suspect that, or she'll know something is not quite right?  \nC8I feel that in time she will distrust me, yes (T: Mhm, mhm).  And also I thought well,  \ngee, what about when she gets a little older and she finds herself in touchy situations.  \nShe probably wouldn't want to admit it to me because she thinks I'm so good and so  \nsweet.  (Points to herself.) And yet I'm afraid she could think I'm really a- a devil.  \nAnd  I  want  so  bad  for  her  to  accept  me.   And  I  don't  know  how  much  a  \nnine-year-old can take.\nT8And really both alternatives concern you.  That she may think you're too good or  \nbetter than you really are.  \nC9Yes.\nT9And she may think you are worse than you are.  \nC10Not worse than I am.  (Smiles) I don't know if she can accept me the way I am.  I \nthink I paint a picture that I'm all sweet and motherly. And -- I'm a little ashamed of  \nmy shady side too. (T:Mhm, mhm)\nT10I see.  It really cuts a little deeper.   If she really knew you, would she, could she  \naccept you?  \nC11This is what I don't know.  Yeah. I don't want her to turn away from me. (T: That  \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Interview, page 6relationship-) And I don't even know how I feel about it because there are times  \nwhen I feel so guilty like when I have a man over, I even try to make a special set -up \nso that if I were ever alone with him, the children would never catch me in that sort  \nof thing.  Because I'm real leery about it (T: Mhm).  And yet I also know that I have  \nthese desires.\nT11And so it’s quite clear it isn't only her problem or the relationship with her, it's in you  \nas well.  \nC12And my guilt. Yeah. Yeah. (T: Oh)  I feel guilty so often. (Moistens lips.)\nT12\"What- What can I accept myself as doing?\"   And uh (C: Yes, Yes) you realize that  \nyou  set  up sort  of subterfuges,  so  as  to  make  sure  that  you're  not  caught  or  \nsomething, you realize that you are acting from guilt,  is that it?  \nC13Yes  (T: Mhm, mhm) and I don't like the ...  I would like to feel comfortable with  \nwhatever I do.  If I choose not to tell Pammy the truth, to feel comfortable that she  \ncan handle it, (T: Mhm, Mhm, Mhm) and I don't.  I want to be honest, and yet I feel  \nthere are some areas that I don't even accept (T: Mhm, Mhm) .\nT13And if you can't accept them in yourself, how could you possibly be comfortable in  \ntelling them to her?  \nC14Right.\nT14Mhm. Mhm. And yet, as you say, you do have these desires and you do have your  \nfeelings, but- but you don't feel good about them. \nC15Right.  (T: Nods and smiles.) (Pause) And I, I, I have a feeling that you are just  \ngoing to sit there and let me stew in it (laughs) and I- I want more.  I want you to  \nhelp me get rid of my guilt feeling.  If I can get rid of my guilt feeling about lying or  \ngoing to bed with a single man, any of that, just so I can feel more comfortable.\nT15Mhm. And I guess I'd like to say, \"No, I don't want to let you stew in your feelings,\"  \nbut on the other hand, I, I also feel that this is the kind of very private thing that I  \ncouldn't possibly answer for you.  But I sure as anything will try to help you work  \ntoward your own answer.   I don't know whether that makes any sense to you, but I  \nmean it.  \nC16Well, I appreciate you saying that.  (Takes her arm off back of chair, now uses both  \nhands to gesture.) You sound like you mean it.  But I don't know where to go.  (T:  \nMhm, Mhm, Mhm) I don't begin to know where to go.  I thought that I had pretty  \nwell worked over most of my guilt, and now that this is coming up I'm disappointed  \nin myself. (T: Mhm, Mhm) I really am. I want- I like it when I feel that no matter  \nwhat I do, even if it's against my own morals or my upbringing, that I can still feel  \ngood about me.  And now I don't.  Like uh, there's a girl at work who sort of mothers  \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Interview, page 7me and she just- she- I think she thinks I'm all sweet, and I sure don't want to show  \nmy more ornery devilish side with her.  I want to be sweet and it's so hard for me to -  \nthis all seems so new again (T: Mhm) and it's so disappointing.\nT16Yeah, I get the disappointment - that here, a lot of these things you’d thought you'd  \nworked through, and now the guilts and the feeling that only a part of you is  \nacceptable to anybody else.  \nC17Yes.\nT17That keeps coming out.  (Pause)  (C: Strains eyebrows.) I guess I do catch the real \ndeep puzzlement that you feel as to \"What the hell shall I do? What can I do?\"  \nC18Yes,  and  do  you  know  what  I  can  find,  doctor,   (Touches  forehead.)  is  that  \neverything I start to do that I st- impulsive, seems natural to tell Pammy, or- or to go  \nout on a date or something, I’m comfortable until I think how I was affected as a  \nchild and the minute that comes up, then I'm all haywire. (T: Mhm)  Like uh, I want  \nto be a good mother so bad, and I feel like I am a good mother, (T: Mhm) but then  \nthere's those little exceptions.  Like my guilts with working.  I want to work and it's  \nso fun having extra money.  I like to work nights.  The minute I think I'm not being  \nreal good to the children or giving them enough time, then I start feeling guilty  \nagain.  Then, that’s when I- it’s uh- what do they call it? (Looks away briefly.) A  \ndouble bind.  That's just what it feels like. I want to do this and it feels right, but after  \nall I'm not being a good mother and I want to be both.  I am becoming more and  \nmore aware of what a perfectionist I am.  That is what it seems I want to be so  \nperfect.  Either I want to become perfect in my standards, or not have that need any  \nmore.\nT18Or, I guess I hear it a little differently -  that uh- what you want is to seem perfect,  but \nit means it’s- a great- a matter of great importance to you to be a good mother and  \nyou want to seem to be a good mother, even if some of your actual feelings differ  \nfrom that. (Points to C.) Is that catching it or not?  \nC19Gee, I don't feel like I am saying that.  (T: Oh, okay) No, that isn't what I feel, really.  \nI want to approve of me always, but my actions won't let me.  I want to approve of  \nme. (Pause) I – I think-  (Strains face.)\nT19I realize ...  you -- alright, but let me -- I’d like to understand it. You sound as though  \nyour actions were kind of outside of you.  You want to approve of you, but what you  \ndo somehow won't let you approve of yourself.  \nC20Right. (Pause) Like I feel that I can't approve of myself regarding, for example  \n(Smiles.), my sex life.  (T: Mhm, Mhm) This is the big thing.  If I really fell in love  \nwith a man and I respected him and I adored him, I don't think I would feel so guilty  \ngoing to bed with him and I don't think I would have to make up any excuses to the  \nchildren because they could see my natural caring for him.  (T: Mhm, Okay) But  \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Interview, page 8when I have the physical desires and I'll say, \"Oh well, why not,\" and I want to  \nanyway, but I feel guilty afterwards.  I hate facing the kids, I don't like looking at  \nmyself, and I rarely enjoy it.  And this is what I mean.  If the circumstances would  \nbe different, I don't think I'd feel so guilty because I'd feel right about it. (Gestures  \nmore profoundly.)\nT20Yeah, I- I guess I hear you saying, \"If what I was doing, when I went to bed with a  \nman, was really genuine and full of love and respect and so on, I wouldn't feel guilty  \nin relation to Pam.  I wouldn’t uh, I, I really would be comfortable about the  \nsituation.\"  \nC21That's how I feel, yeah. (Smiles.) And I know that sounds like I want a perfect  \nsituation, but that is how I feel. And in the meantime, I can't stop these desires.  I  \ntried that also.  I’ve tried saying, \"O.K., I don't like myself when I do that so I won't  \ndo it any more.\"  But then I resent the children.  I think, why should they stop me  \nfrom doing what I want, and it is really not that bad.\nT21But I guess I heard you saying too, that it isn't only the children, but you don't like it \nas well when it isn't really ...  \nC22Right.  I'm sure that - I know that's it, probably even more so than I'm aware of.  But  \nI only notice it so much when I pick it up in the children.  Then I can also notice it in  \nmyself. (Touches her face.)\nT22And somehow, sometimes, you kind of uh, feel like blaming them for the feelings  \nyou have.  I mean, why should they cut you out from a normal sex life, huh? \nC23Well, a sex life, I could say, not normal because there is something about me that  \nsays that's not very healthy – to uh just go into sex because you feel physically  \nattracted or something, or a physical need.  So, something about it tells me that that's  \nnot quite right anyway. (Still touching her face.)\nT23Mhm. (Pause) But you feel, really, that at times you’re acting in ways that are not in  \naccord with your own inner standards.  \nC24Right.  Right.\nT24But then you were also saying, a minute ago, that you feel you can't help that uh-  \neither.  \nC25I wish I could.  That's it, and I can't - now I feel like I- I can't control myself as \nwell as I could have before.  For a specific reason now, I can't.  I just let go and I \nhave- there’s too many things I do wrong that I have to feel guilty for, and I sure \ndon't like that.  I want you very much to give me a direct answer, and I'm going to \nask it, and I don't expect a direct answer, (Smiles.) but I want to know.  Do you \nfeel that - to me the most important thing is to be open and honest and if I can be \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Interview, page 9open and honest with my children, do you feel that it could harm them?  If for \nexample, I could say to Pammy, \"I was- I felt bad lying to you, Pammy, and I \nwant to tell you the truth now,\" and if I tell her the truth and she’s shocked at me \nand she’s upset, that that could bother her more?  I was- I want to get rid of my \nguilts and that will help me, but I don't want to put ‘em on her. (Points away from \nherself.)\nT25That's right.\nC26Do you feel that that could hurt her?\nT26That’s a real concern. I guess uh -  I am sure this will sound evasive to you, but it  \nseems to me that perhaps the person you are not being uh fully honest with is you?  \n(C: Sure) Because I was very much struck by the fact that you were saying, \"If I feel  \nall right about what I have done, whether it's going to bed with a man or what, if I  \nreally feel all right about it, then I do not have any concern about what I would tell  \nPam or my relationship with her.\"  (Shakes head.)\nC27Right.  All right.  Now I hear what you are sayin’. (Sighs) (Shifts back and forth in  \nchair.) Then all right, then I want to work on (T: It’s kind of tough, huh?) -- I wanna  \nwork on accepting me, then.  I want to work on feeling all right about it.  But that  \nmakes sense.  That that will come natural and then I won't have to worry about  \nPammy. (T: Mhm.)  But when things do seem so wrong for me and I have an  \nimpulse to do them, how can I accept that?\nT27What you'd like to do is to feel more accepting toward yourself when you do things  \nthat you feel are wrong.  Is that right?  \nC28Right. And I feel like, I feel like… \nT28(Smiling) It sounds like a tough assignment.  \nC29Yeah, I feel like you are going to say, \"Now why do you think they’re wrong?\" and  \nuh, I have mixed feelings there too. (T: Mhm) Through therapy I will say, \"Now  \nlook, I know this is natural.  Women feel it - sure, we don't talk about it lots socially  \nbut all women feel it and it's very natural.\"  I have had sex for the last 11 years and  \nI’m- of course going to want it, but I still think it is wrong unless you’re really, truly  \nin love with a man, and my body doesn't seem to agree.  And so I don't know how to  \naccept it.\nT29It sounds like a triangle to me, isn't it? You feel that I, or therapists in general, or  \nother people say, \"It is all right, it is all right, it’s natural enough, go ahead.\" Um, and  \nI guess you feel your body sort of lines up on that side of the picture.  (Points to C. )  \nBut something in you says, \"But I don't like it that way, not unless it’s really right.\"  \nC30Right.  (Long Pause) (Sighs, then speaks in a slower, somber way.) Well, I have a  \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Interview, page 10hopeless feeling.  (T: Mhm) I mean, these are all the things that I sort of feel myself,  \nand I feel uh - O.K., now what?\nT30Mhm. You feel this is the conflict and it's just insoluble, and therefore it is hopeless,  \nand here you look to me and I don't seem to give you any help and that uh- \nC31Right.  I uh- I really know you can't answer for me, and I have to figure it out  \nmyself, but I want you to guide me or show me where to start or - so it won't look so  \nhopeless.  I know I can keep living with this conflict and I know eventually things  \nwould work out, but I'd like feeling more comfortable with the way I live – (T:  \nMhm, mhm.) and I'm not.\nT31One thing I might ask, what is it you wish I would say to you?  \nC32I wish you would say to me (Smiles): to be honest and take the risk that Pammy’s  \ngoing to accept me.  And I also have a feeling if I could really risk it with Pammy, of  \nall people, that I'd be able to say, \"Here's this little kid that can accept me, and I'm  \nreally not that bad.\"  If she really knows what a demon I am and still loves me and  \naccepts me, it seems like it would help me to accept me more - like it's really not that  \nbad. (T: Mhm)  I want you to say to go ahead and be honest, but I don't want the  \nresponsibility that it would upset her. (T: I see.) That is where I don't want to take  \nresponsibility.\nT32So you know, yeah - You know very well what you'd like to do in the relationship.  \nYou would like to be yourself and you'd like to have her know that you're not perfect  \nand do things that maybe even she wouldn't approve of, and that you disapprove of  \nto some degree yourself, but that uh- somehow she would love you and accept you  \nas an imperfect person.  \nC33Yes.  Like I wonder if my mother had been more open with me, maybe I wouldn't  \nhave had such a narrow attitude about sex.  If I would have thought that she could  \nbe, you know, pretty sexy and ornery, and devilish too, that I wouldn't look at her as  \nbeing such a sweet mother, that she could also be the other side.  But she didn't talk  \nabout that. (Shakes her head.)  (T: Mhm) Maybe that's where I got my picture.  I  \ndon't know, but I want Pammy to see me as a full woman, but also accept me.\nT33You don't sound so uncertain.  \nC34I don't?  (Tilts head and smiles.) What do you mean?\nT34What I mean is you have been sitting there telling me just what you would like to do  \nin that relationship with Pam.  \nC35(Appears confused.) I would, but I don't want to quite take the risk of doing it (T: I  \ncan understand) unless an authority tells me that …\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Interview, page 11T35(Eyes moistening, hands clasped.)  It’s, I guess one thing that I feel very keenly is  \nthat it's an awful risky thing to live.  (Pause)  (Hands unclasp.) You'd be taking a  \nchance on your relationship with her and taking a chance on letting her know who  \nyou are, really.  \nC36(Pause) Yeah.  But then if I don't take the chance, if I feel loved and accepted by her,  \nI'll never feel good about it anyway.\nT36Mhm. Mhm. If her love and acceptance of you is based on a false picture of you,  \nwhat the hell is the good of that?  Is that- is that what you are saying?  \nC37Yeah, that’s what I mean, yes. But I also feel there is a lot of responsibility with  \nbeing a mother.  With I don’t- I don't want to feel like I have caused any big traumas  \nin the children.  I don't like all that responsibility.  I think that's it.  I don't like it,  \nfeeling it could be my fault.\nT37Mhm. I guess that's what I meant when I said, \"Life is risky.\"  It’s uh- to take the  \nresponsibility for being the person you would like to be with her is a hell of a  \nresponsibility.  \nC38It is.\nT38A very frightening one.  \nC39And you know, I- I look at it two ways.  I like to see myself as being so honest with  \nthe kids, and really being proud of myself so that no matter what I told them or no  \nmatter how bad they think I was, I was honest (points at herself) (T: Mhm) and  \ndown deep it’s gonna be a much more wholesome relationship, and yet you know, I  \nget jealous of like when they are with their daddy.  I feel he’s more flip, he’s not  \nquite as real, he’s not quite as honest, but nevertheless, they see a sweet picture of  \ntheir dad.  You know, he is all goodness and light, and I am envious of that too.  I  \nwant them to see me just as sweet as they see him and yet I know he is not quite as  \nreal with them.  So it seems like I've got to swap the one for the other, and I know  \nthis is really what I want the most, but uh, I miss some of that glory.\nT39Yeah. You sort of feel, “I want them to have just as nice a picture of me as they have  \nof their dad, (C: I do. Right) and if his is a little phony, then maybe mine will have to  \nbe too.”  I think that's putting it a little too strongly, but-   \nC40But that’s close.  That is what I mean.  So uh- But I know she can't have that neat a  \npicture of me, if I were honest. (Big smile)  (T: Laughs)  Besides that, I do feel that  \nI’m a little more ornery than their dad anyway.   So I'm likely to do more things that  \nthey’d disapprove of.\nT40Sounds like you really find it quite hard to believe that they would really love you if  \nthey knew you?  \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Interview, page 12C41That's right.  You know that's exactly it.  Before therapy, I would have definitely  \nchosen the other area.  I’m going to get respect from them no matter what - even if I  \nhave to lie.\nT41I see.\nC42But right now, I know that's not true (T: Mhm, mhm) and I'm not positive they'll  \ntruly accept me.  Something tells me they will.  I know they will, but I am not  \npositive.  I want reassurance.  I keep wanting these things.\nT42And now you are kind of in a no-man's-land of probably shifting from one point of  \nview toward them to another, but boy you'd sure like somebody to say, \"That's right,  \nyou go ahead and do it.\"  (Gestures to sides.)\nC43Yes. Yes.  That's why I get encouraged when I read in a book from somebody I  \nrespect and admire, that this is the right thing no matter what - honesty will win out.  \nWell then, that keeps giving me confidence. “By gosh, I'm right.”  But I ...\nT43It is so damned hard to really choose something on your own, isn't it?  \nC44Which makes me feel rea- very immature.  I don't like this in me.  I wish I were  \ngrown up enough or mature enough to make my decisions and stick by them, but I  \nneed somebody to help me on - somebody to push me.\nT44So that you kind of reproach yourself for that,  I guess. And feel, \"Why, if I was  \nanybody, or if I was grown up, I'd be mature enough to decide things like this for  \nmyself.\"  \nC45Right. Right.  And take more risks.  I wish I’d take more risks.  I wish that I could  \njust go ahead and be this and say, however the children grow up, I've done my best.  \nI didn’t have to constantly have this conflict.  And I'd like, in later years, to say, \"No  \nmatter what you asked me kids, at least I told you the truth.  You may not have liked  \nit, but it's been the truth.\"  (Camera pans towards hands.) That, somehow, I can  \nadmire.  (T: Mhm.) I- I disrespect people that lie.  I hate it so, you see what a double  \nbind I am in.  I hate myself if I'm bad, but I also hate myself if I lie.  So uh, it's  \naccepting.  I want to become more accepting. \nT45I guess, judging from your tone of voice, you sound as though you hate yourself  \nmore when you lie than you do in terms of things you disapprove of in behavior.  \nC46I do.  I do because this has really bothered me.  This happened with Pammy about a  \nmonth ago and it keeps coming to my mind.  I don't know whether to go back and  \ntalk to her about it or wait.  She may have even forgotten what she asked me, but uh  \n– it just-\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Interview, page 13T46The point is, you haven't forgotten.  \nC47I haven...  No, I haven't. And I would like, at least, to be able to tell her that I  \nremember lying and I am sorry I lied and it has been driving me bugs because I did.  \n(Pause)  I do- Now I feel like - now that's solved - and I didn't even solve a thing, but  \nI feel relieved.  (T: Mhm, Mhm.) I uh- I do feel like you have been saying to me –  \nyou’re not say- giving me advice, but I do feel like you are saying, \"You really  \nwanna- You know what pattern you want to follow Gloria, and go ahead and follow  \nit.\"  I sort of feel a backing up from you.\nT47I guess the way I sense it is uh, you've been telling me that you know what you want  \nto do and yes, I do believe in backing up people in what they want to do.  It’s just a  \nlittle different slant than the way it seems to you.  \nC48Are you telling me...\nT48You see, one thing  that concerns  me  is uh,.. It's  no damn  good you’re  doing  \nsomething that you haven't really chosen to do.  That’s why I am trying to help you  \nfind out what your own inner choices are. \nC49But then there's also a conflict there because I am not really positive what I wanna  \ndo.  The lying part, yes, but I am not positive what I wanna do when I go against  \nmyself. (T: Sure)  Like when I bring a man to the house.  I am not sure I want to do  \nthat.  If I feel guilty afterward, I must not have really wanted to.\nT49And I am interested that you say -  I'm not just sure which words you used  - but you \ndon’t want- you don’t like yourself or don't approve of it when you do something  \nagainst yourself.  (C: Hand to her face.)\nC50Yes. You know, this is so different.  Now this kind of thing we are talking about  \nnow, it isn't just knowing whether you want to do something or not.  If I want to go  \nto work in the morning or if I don't want to go to work, that's easy.  (Both hands  \npalms up.) But when I find myself doing something I don't feel comfortable with, I  \nautomatically say, \"If you’re not comfortable Gloria, it’s not right.  Something’s  \nwrong.\"  All right now.  What I want to ask you is, how can I know which is the  \nstrongest?  Because I do it, does that mean that’s the strongest?  And yet, if I  \ndisapproved, that's just part of the thing that’s got to go along with it?  You see, it  \nsounds like you...  (Points at self with both hands.) I'm picking up a contradiction.  \nI’m not under- I’m not following.\nT50It sounds like you’re feeling a contradiction in yourself too, although you- what I  \nheard  you  saying  in  part  is  uh,  the  way  you  like  it  is  when  you  feel  really  \ncomfortable about what you are doing.  \nC51Yes, and I have at times, when I’ve made a decision.  Now that seems right.  (T:  \nMhm) That seems perfectly right - no conflict - but then there are times I do things  \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Interview, page 14that I feel uncomfortable with.  So that there is a conflict there. (T: Mhm) It's not the  \nsame at all.  So, what I'm saying is, how do I really know when I am following my  \ntrue feelings, if I have conflicts afterwards or guilt afterwards?\n \nT51I see.  Because in the moment, it may seem like your true feelings. \nC52Yes.  Like if I’m starting to do it -- O.K.\nT52Mhm. Mhm. So that really is tough ah ...  When if you feel comfortable in the  \nmoment about it, but then afterwards don't feel at all comfortable, which course of  \naction was really the one you should have followed?  \nC53You know, the most outstanding thing - I don't know if you are following me, when  \nI say about this conflict - the one thing I know is I’ve wanted, for example, to leave  \nmy husband for quite a few years.  I never did it.  I kept thinking how nice it would  \nbe, or how scary it would be, but I never did it.  And all of a sudden when I did, it  \nfelt right.  I didn't feel mean toward him.  I just knew this was what I had to do.  \nThat's when I know I am following myself.  I am following my feelings completely.  \nI have no conflict there.  Some unhappy things came from it (T: sure), but I still have  \nno conflict.  That, to me, is when I am following my feelings.  And in everyday life  \nthe small little decisions, the small little things to do don't come out that clear at all.  \nSo many conflicts come with them.  (T: Mhm, that’s right) Is this natural? (Knits  \neyebrows.)\nT53Although you are saying – uh, I expect it is – but, but you’re saying too that you  \nknow perfectly well the feeling within yourself that occurs when you are really  \ndoing something that's right for you.  \nC54I do.  I do.  (Face relaxes.) And I miss that feeling other times. And it's right away a  \nclue to me.\nT54Mhm. You can really listen to yourself sometimes and realize, \"Oh no, this isn't the  \nright feeling.  This isn't – this isn’t the way I would feel if I was doing what I really  \nwanted to do.\"  \nC55But yet, many times I will go along and do it anyway. And say, \"Oh well, I'm in the  \nsituation now, I'll just remember next time.\"  I mentioned this word a lot in therapy  \nand most therapists grin at me or giggle or something when I say \"utopia,\" but when  \nI do follow a feeling and I feel this good feeling inside of me, that's sort of utopia.  \nThat's what I mean.  That's the way I like to feel whether it's a bad thing or a good  \nthing.  But I feel right about me. This is what I wanna…\nT55I, I sense that in those utopian moments, you really feel kind of whole.  You feel all  \nin one piece.  \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Interview, page 15C56Yes.  Yeah, it gives me a choked up feeling when you say that because I don't get  \nthat as often as I'd like. (Smiles.) I like that whole feeling.  That's real precious to  \nme. (Touches her face.)\nT56I expect none of us get it as often as we'd like, but I really do understand it.  (Pause)  \n(C: Tears come to her eyes.)  Mhm, that really does touch you, doesn't it? \nC57Yeah, and you know what else I was just thinking? I – I feel dumb saying it uh - that  \nall of a sudden while I was talking to you I thought, \"Gee, how nice I can talk to you  \nand I want you to approve of me and I respect you, but I miss that my father couldn't  \ntalk to me like you are.\" (Touches her chin.) I mean, I'd like to say, \"Gee, I'd like you  \nfor my father.\"  (T: Mhm, Mhm, Mhm) I don't even know why that came to me.  \n(Smiles)\nT57You look to me like a pretty nice daughter.  (Pause) (C: Looks down.)  But you really  \ndo miss the fact that you- you couldn't be open with your own dad. \nC58Yeah, I couldn't be open, but I, I wanna blame it on him.  I think I’m more open than  \nhe'd allow me.  He would never listen to me talk like you are and not disapprove, not  \nlower me down.  I thought of this the other day.  Why do I always have to be so  \nperfect?  I know why.  He always wanted me to be perfect.  I always had to be better  \n(touches her lips) and uh... yeah, I miss that.\nT58You were just trying like hell to be the girl he wanted you to be.  \nC59Yet at the same time, rebelling.\nT59That's right.  Sure. (Nods)\nC60(Gesturing with left hand from the side of her head.) Like I almost gloated writing  \nhim a letter the other day and telling him I am a waitress, which I expect him to  \ndisapprove of. I go out at nights and I almost gloated hitting him back - like, \"Now  \nhow do you like me?\"  (T: Uh-huh, Uh-huh) And yet, I really want acceptance and  \nlove from him.  I mean, I know he loves me.\nT60So you slap at him and say, \"This is what I am, now see.\"  \nC61Yeah. (T: But you- yeah)  \"You raised me, how do you like it?\"  But do you know  \nwhat I want him to say?  \"I knew this was you all along, honey, and I really love  \nyou.\" (Wipes a tear with finger.)\nT61Oh, I see. You really feel badly that you think there is very little chance he will say  \nthat.  \nC62No.  He won't.  He doesn't hear.  (Her voice sad and resigned.)  I went back home to  \nhim about two years ago, really wanting to let him know I loved him although I’ve  \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Interview, page 16been afraid of him.  And he doesn't hear me.  He just keeps saying things like,  \n\"Honey, you know I love you.  You know I have always loved you.\"  He doesn't  \nhear.  (Her eyes moisten.)\nT62That was…  He’s never really known you and loved you and this, somehow, is what  \nbrings the tears inside.\n  \nC63I don't know what it is.  You know, when I talk about it, it feels more flip.  If I just sit  \nstill a minute, it feels like a great big hurt down there.  That I uh, feel cheated.  \n(Reaches for kleenex, wipes her eye.)\nT63Mhm. Mhm. It is much eas… It’s much easier to uh be a little flip, because then you  \ndon't feel that big lump inside of hurt.   \nC64Mhm. (Nodding) And again, that's a hopeless situation.  I tried working on it, and  \nuh, I feel it's something I have to accept.  My father just isn't the type of man I'd  \nreally like.  I'd like somebody more understanding and caring.  He cares, but not in  \nthe way that we can cooperate or communicate.\nT64Mhm. You feel “nope” that, \"I am permanently cheated.\"  \nC65Mhm. That is why I like substitutes.  Like I like talking to you and I like men that I  \ncan respect. Doctors, and I keep sort of maybe underneath a feeling like we’re real  \nclose, you know, and it’s sort of like a substitute father.\nT65I don't feel that's pretending.  \nC66Well, you are not really my father (laughs). (Raises her eyebrows.)\nT66No, I meant about the real close business. \nC67Well, see, I sort of feel that's pretending too, because I can't expect you to feel very  \nclose to me.  You don't know me that well. (Fingering kleenex.)\nT67Well, all I can do is what I am feeling-  that is I feel close to you in this moment.  \n(Long Pause.)\nC68[The remainder is not on the film – only on audio recording]\nWell, O.K., I'd just like more of it I guess.\nT68Do you feel as though that's a big need, that it would take a lot of caring and a lot of  \nunderstanding to fill it up?  \nC69Exactly.  And I have been so busy trying to get rid of my neurosis.  I'd like to have  \nthis one neurosis filled.  I'd like to just find someone who is going to love me like a  \nfather.  I even want this in boyfriends.  I always want to get an older man that's  \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Interview, page 17caring and more mature and not so flip.\nT69One of the things you really deeply want is to find a father whom you would love  \nand respect and who would really like you as you are, and not to just like perfection. \nC70That's right.  And it seems ironic that since I have been away from my husband, the  \nonly type of man I go out with are the kind I don't respect - are the young, flip, not  \ncaring, 'smart aleck' kind of guy.  Not somebody that's really, you know, that I can  \nrespect.  That seems like such a big thing.\nT70The phrase that comes to my mind - I don't know if it is appropriate or not - you're  \nslapping your father in the face, aren't you?  \nC71Oh?  By wanting mature men?\nT71No.  By going out with those who are quite unlike the ones you'd really want.  \nC72But I don't mean to.  I don't understand why they keep coming around.\nEND of FILM and AUDIORECORDING\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Interview, page 18Rogers’ Post-Session Commentary\nIn spite of feeling initially the artificiality of the situation, particularly the hot lights, I \nvery quickly became oblivious to the outside situation, and I think that Gloria did too. In many \nways I'm glad that she kept pushing me for an answer to her very personal questions about her \nsex life and her relationship to her daughter. I say I'm glad of this because as the relationship \ndeveloped, it became I think completely clear to her as well as to me that she was seeking \nsomething a good deal deeper than that. Incidentally, I'd like to pay my tribute to her deep \nhonesty in being willing to talk about herself so freely.\nAlthough every individual is entirely unique, and in this respect I was definitely \nunprepared for and sometimes surprised by the material she brought up - still, in another sense, \nthis was very typical of my experiences in therapy. When I am able really to let myself enter into  \na relationship, and I feel that this was true in this instance, then I find myself not only being \nincreasingly moved by being in touch with the inner world of my client, but I find myself \nbringing out my own inner experience, statements which seem to have no connection with what's  \ngoing on, but which usually prove to be, or prove to have, a very significant relationship to what \nthe client is experiencing. I felt there were one o two incidents of this kind in this brief interview.\nI was genuinely moved, I probably showed it, by the fact that she told me near the end of \nthe contact that, uh, she saw me as the father she would like to have. My reply was also a \nthoroughly spontaneous one that she seemed to me like a pretty nice daughter. I guess I feel that \nwe're only playing with the real world of relationships when we talk about such an experience in \nterms of transference and counter-transference. I feel quite deeply about that. I want to say, yes, \nwe can put this experience into some such highly intellectualized framework, but when we do \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Post-Session Commentary, page 19that it completely misses the point of the very immediate \"I-Thou\" quality of the relationship at \nsuch moments. I felt that Gloria and I really encountered each other and that in some small but, I \nbelieve, lasting way, we were each of us enriched by the experience. I am saying these things \nalmost immediately after the conclusion of the interview and as is characteristic of me, there are \nnot more than one or two statements or incidents which I recall from the interview. I simply \nknow that I was very much present in the relationship, that I lived it in the moment of its \noccurrence, and I realize that after a time I may begin to remember it too. But at the present time,  \nI really have a very non-specific memory of the whole interview. I'll try to look at it, though, a \nlittle bit more from an intellectual rather than a strictly feeling point of view. Gloria showed what  \nI have come to feel are characteristic elements of therapeutic movement. In the first part of the \ninterview, she was talking about her feelings and they were past feelings.. She was talking about \naspects of her behavior and of herself as if she didn't quite own them. She was looking outside \nherself for a center, or a locus of evaluation, some source of authority. She saw some of the \nthings she was talking about in fairly black and white fashion. By the end of the interview, she \nwas experiencing her feelings in the immediate moment, not only as evidenced by her tears, but \nby her ability to express very directly and with immediacy her feelings toward me. She was also \nmuch more aware of her ability to make her own judgments and choices. I guess, put in terms \nthat have become somewhat commonplace, you could say that she moved from the \"there and \nthen\" of her life to the \"here and now\" of elements that she was discovering in herself feelings \nwhich she was experiencing in the moment in her relationship with me. All in all, I feel good \nabout the interview. I guess I feel good about myself in the interview and like Gloria, I feel very \nreal regret that the relationship cannot continue.\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Post-Session Commentary, page 20This transcript is available for purposes of research, study and teaching.

M. (1975). Carl Rogers’ 4th Interview with Sylvia [Film].]\nAfter filming, comments by Sylvia and Rogers were inserted. The bracketed italicized \ndialogue indicates the voiced over comments.  \n[Carl Rogers: This is my fourth interview with Sylvia.  A year previous, Sylvia had been a  \nmember of a workshop in which I offered to put on a demonstration interview.  I asked \nfor volunteers and she was the first one to volunteer.  In front of that workshop audience,  \nI held three interviews with Sylvia.  Then a year, uh, intervened before this fourth \ninterview.  The interview will be, uh, shown as it was recorded, but with, uh, comments \nboth from Sylvia and from myself, at points where we felt we wished to clarify what was \ngoing on, uh, or to, to, uh, make some comment about what was going on .]  \nCarl: Hi.\nSylvia: Hi Carl. (They both sit down, facing each other.)\nC:   Good to see ya.\nS 1:  I’ve been looking forward to this moment.\nC 1: Well, I’m eager to know what’s what with you.\nS 2: (Looks down.) (Pause 8 seconds.) (Leans back.) Well, do you mean in terms of the \npast year or right now?  \n1 This Sylvia, in session #4, is the same person as the client in the film “The Struggle for Self-Acceptance” \n- session #5 with Sylvia.\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 21 C 2: Oh, right now, whatever your concerns are in your present life. (S: Mhm hm)  I \nguess that’s what I’m interested in.\nS 2: Well, um, (smiles) I come here with an agenda, (C: Okay.) like, of a particular thing \nI’d like to discuss with you. (C: All right.) And, and I think that discussing it will be  \nhelpful in terms of my, of my life.  \nC 2:  Uh-huh. Then that’s what I’d like you to discuss.\nS 3: Well, I think I’m doing very well in many ways, and I need to do some work,           \n(C: M-hm.) too. (C: M-hm.) And, uh, the most pressing thing with me is that I plan \nto go to work in the fall, ( C: Nods.) full-time, ( C: Nods.) and have the care of both \nof my sons. (C: Nods.)  Without any support other than what I’m earning. (4 second \npause.) And I, and I, I don’t feel very upset about it, but I believe that deep down in \nmy body I’m really afraid. (Smiles.)\nC 3: Are you afraid of the responsibility or, or what aspect of it is most frightening?\nS 4: Well what, what seems most frightening as I think about it is coming home from \nwork very tired (C: M-hm.) and having, um, two little boys that need a lot. (C: M-\nhm.) (Her voice quivers.)\nC 4: Will you really be able to be a mother to them when they, (hands Sylvia tissue box.) \nwhen you come home from work. Hmmm?\nS 5: Well, I’m sure I can do it (gets teary) because I, it’s done every day.  And, uh, the \nwomen I know an… who are trying to do that are having a really hard time. (C: M-\nhm.) (3 seconds pause.)  And I’ve been thinking about talking about this problem \nnow with you.  I haven’t really… I, I talk about in a heady way with my friends, \nand, uh, I haven’t given myself any real support (C: M-hm.) with it. It’s a real fear I \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 22 have, and it’ll probably be really hard. (C: M-hm.)\n[Carl: It’s interesting that, uh, because she had saved up this problem to talk about that \nthe moment she begins to talk about it she begins to, to, uh, get teary - that’s why I \nreached for the, uh, Kleenex, which she didn’t use. But, uh, it’s evident that, uh, though \nshe may have talked about it in a, in an intellectual fashion to her friends, uh, it really \ndoes have a lot of emotional import for her.]\n[Sylvia: Well, I, I don’t know if it’s obvious to you but I started to cry when I said that \nand you know why, you know, I was feeling a lot of sadness.]\nC 5: (Talking at the same time) And you haven’t really had a chance to explore it in, in \ndepth; you’ve talked about it more on a, on the surface level.\nS 5: Well, the exploring I’ve done is… (3 seconds pause) I decided for myself- well \nsimple, I’ll look for other single working mothers ( C: Nods.) with young children \nwho are doing well. ( C: M-hm.)  And I’ll talk to them and see what they do. ( C: M-\nhm.)  So I started asking, asking my friends, asking some people I know, “Do you \nknow of this kind of person?”  Well after about a month, (quiet laugh) I didn’t come  \nup with one, (C: Is that right?) one single woman taking care of young children and \nworking full-time who was doing very well ( C: Nods.) and that scared me.\nC 6: So the track record, the track record that the other people have, the other women \nhave makes you really concerned about will you be able to do it?\nS 7:  Well that substantiates my concern.\nC 8: Yeah. Yeah.\nS 9:  I’ve had the concern. ( C: Yeah. M-hm.) (Pause 8 seconds.) ( C: M-hm.)  I wish, \n(smiles.) I keep wishing I could find some secrets to make it easier for myself. And \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 23 the only secrets I can come up with are working half-time ( C: Nods.) and being \nreally, like, no… (C: M-hm.) just barely, you know, paying rent and ( C: M-hm.) \nfood and so forth and so on. ( C: Mhm.)  But, I do know how to do that (pauses) and \nthat may be what I decide to do.\nC 9:   It’s one possible option at any rate.  Mhm.\nS 10:  But it seems like a real limited lifestyle.\nC 10:  It is clear to me from the, from the tears that came up the first that, that, uh, this is \nsomething you feel a lot of concern about, isn’t it?\nS 11:  Oh, I feel I’m two things (crying).  All alone ( C: Mhm.) and somewhat doomed to \nfail. \n[Carl: I think, at this part, she was feeling, um, uh, quite discouraged after following a \nvery good plan.  Some of the responses along here are almost mechanical, like, um, my \nsaying that’s another option.  But then when I do pick up on the, uh, feeling that she had \nexhibited at the first, it, uh, brings up fresh all of the feeling that’s, uh, stirred up around \nthat.  And, uh, I think my response shows that I’m doing what I, what I customarily try to \ndo.  It is to live in the client’s experience and to feel whatever she’s feeling.  This is the \nimportant thing to really go with the client into whatever feelings there are.  And here I \nreally go with her into her sadness.  At times I, uh, feel almost as though I’m speaking for  \nthe client.  And to me that’s, um, the relationship is good at those times. I feel as though, \nuh, I’m in the client’s world. I’m saying things that she could be saying.  And, uh, when \nshe says, “That’s right” it shows I have been right where she’s experiencing it .]\nC 11: Mhm.  Mhm. Mhm.\nS 12: And, uh, (clears throat) doomed to fail, not that I will die or ( C: Mhm.) anything.  I \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 24 think doomed to fail and to be there for my children ( C: Mhm. Mhm.) in a \npositive, cheerful, ( C: Mhm.) warm, loving way. ( C: Mhm. Mhm.) And being a \nsingle parent, like I will be ( C: Mhm.) their support system to a large extent. ( C: \nMhm.)  And it scares me to think of their main support as being exhausted ( C: \nMhm.) and irritated ( C: Mhm.) and (C: Mhm.) … (3 seconds pause.)\nC 13: You just feel, “I may not be able to make it.  I may be doomed (Sylvia smiles and \nnods.) to failure by the very circumstances.”\nS 14: Right. (Nods.) (C: Mhm.) (10 second pause.) And talking about it this way I feel \ntwo ways:  Like, “Oh c’mon Sylvia.  Everybody else is doing it too.”  And on the \nother hand, like, you’re willing to sit here and talk (laughs) about it with me ( C: \nMhm.) and I appreciate that. (Voice breaks.)\nC 14: Mhm. Mhm. But you don’t have to just tell yourself, “Oh, buck up, you can do it.”  \nIt’s, it gives you a good chance to really…\nS 15: (Takes Kleenex and wipes eyes.) Right. Well, I do do that, “Buck up, you can do \nit.”  I’ll do that plenty.  But I don’t get much opportunity to, ( C: Nods.) to be sad \nwith somebody about it. ( C: Yeah.)  How hard it ( C: Yeah.) seems. (Crying.)\nC 15: Yeah. Yeah. That’s the thing isn’t it?  That to be all alone, with no support from \nanybody, it sounds like…\nS 16: Well, I mean (C: I mean…) there are people that (C: Yeah, I know but…) care \nabout me. (C: But…)  There’s, like, no financial ( C: Yeah.) support. (C: Mhm.) \nAnd it’s not like I’ll have my mother next door, ( C: Mhm.) or something like that.\nC 16: You’ll be alone with a heavy burden and it is a sad prospect really.  \nS 17: (Nods head.) (Pause 3 seconds.) It feels sad. (C: Mhm. Mhm. Mhm.)  And I get… \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 25 when I, (pauses) I depress myself by thinking, “Well, oh, sure I can give up my \nchildren.” And I think, “Well, I won’t do that.”  Um, I’m seeing it as a black or \nwhite thing (C: Mhm.) and I know that’s not reality.  \nC 17: (Nods.) But it feels like reality.  That either you’d have to give up your children or, \nor else (S: Mhm.) make a go of it.\nS 18: But then I also feel suspicious of myself.  Like, “Well, Sylvia, you’re used to so \nmuch of getting your needs met.”  Like, going out at night sometimes, ( C: Mhm.) \num, having friends, ( C: Mhm.) and, and having a social life and not being overtired.  \n(C: Mhm.)  And then I see myself as pampered. ( C: Nods and smiles.)  And, uh, if I  \njust wasn’t so pampered, (laughs) things would be a lot better.\nC 18: That’s when you kind of scold yourself, (: Uh-huh.) really. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. \n(pause 7 seconds) So that you really feel you’re gonna be hemmed in by that.  I \nmean, your life is gonna be constricted ( S: Mhm.) a good deal.  A lot of the things \nyou’ve been used to you just won’t have.\nS 19: And want for myself.\nC 19: And want for yourself. ( S: Nods.) Uh-huh.\nS 20: Yeah, that’s right.\nC 20: So really it does look like a very tough period, doesn’t it? \nS 21: Yep. It does. (pause 13 seconds) But, I like being able to be sad and complain about  \nhow terrible I’m afraid it’s going to be then I can… like now I’m feeling like, and \nI’m excited too, you know, about facing it.\nC 21: Sort of a new phase of your life? Is it… it has excitement as well as dread in it, I \nguess.\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 26 S 21: (Nods.) Yeah about seeing what it will be like, ( C: Mhm.) in fact. (C: Mhm.) \n(Sighs).  \n[Sylvia: I smiled (C: Mhm .)  a little bit there and I think that I was feeling like a relief of  \ntension or, um,  I don’t know how to describe it but a relief of, of after crying and feeling  \nsad and then having that feeling pass  (C: Mhm. to something else.]\n[Carl: It’s, uh, it’s very often true that if, uh, I go with a client into sad or desperate or \nnegative feelings that (clears throat) then that satisfies that aspect of their experience \nand then they can move on to something else.  So that it’s very common to have positive \nfeelings, uh, follow, uh, very, uh, negative ones. Also I might just comment here that, uh, \nthese pauses seemed very brief to me, uh, but to some therapists, to some counselors, uh, \na pause is very hard to bear.  I don’t find pauses hard to bear.  This was her silence and \nI was willing to let her have it and to speak up when she was ready.  During those \npauses, I’m very quiet inside. Um, I really am quite content to wait.  Uh, sometimes I am \nreviewing what she has been experiencing.  Um, but I’m not, uh, I’m not trying to look  \nahead, and I’m not thinking about the process.  I’m just trying to feel it as it might be \ngoing on in her.]\nC 21:  It will be a new adventure but it’s one that, uh, you feel different ways about.\nS 22: Mhm. Yeah. So that’s, that’s what I think about the most, in terms of a problem \narea. (C: Mhm. Mhm.) Like, the (smiles) way I started crying it seemed like I just \ncouldn’t wait to get here and cry about it. ( C: Mhm. Mhm. Mhm.) It was a little \ndramatic that way.\nC 22: ‘Cos it is…well, it is, it is a real sad prospect.  And one, I guess, that you don’t let \nout too much to other people, the sad side of it.\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 27 S 23: Right, I don’t do that ( C: Nods.) very well.  I, ( C: Mhm.) I am busy being strong \n(C: Mhm.) unconsciously. Or I’m also busy being depressed. ( C: Mhm.) (Sylvia \nsmiles) I’ve learned well.  I believe being sad and scared are more dealing with ( C: \nMhm. Mmm.) the problem.\nC 23: Mhm. Yeah being, being frightened of what you’re taking on and sad of what \nyou’re losing for yourself. ( S: Nods.) Those are two very real ( S: Hmm.) feelings.\nS 24: And I, (pauses) I also think that part of my fear and excitement is that I’ll be doing \nsomething different. Like, I’ve never worked ( C: Nods.) in, in my profession ( C: \nMhm. Mhm.) and been like a confident, ( C: Mhm.) single woman with young \nchildren (C: Mhm.) who are doing well. ( C: Mhm.)  And it’s like, um, that’s what I  \nwant for myself. (C: Mhm.) (Sylvia laughs.)\nC 24: It’s a goal you’ve been working toward. ( S: Nods.)  Mhm.  (3 seconds pause.) I \nwonder sort of how do your children feel about this?\n[Carl: Here I simply, um, followed my impulse because I found myself thinking about her \nchildren, I raised that question with her.  Uh, whether that was a good move or not from \na counseling point of view is, uh, hard to say until we see what happens next.  You might \nthink in viewing this that, uh, I had, uh, thought about what was going on and decided, \n“Here’s a, uh, here’s a piece that’s missing.  Here’s something she hasn’t talked  about.”  \nActually that’s not the process that goes on in me.  Uh, I try to be open to whatever wells \nup in me and to say that, to, to act more, uh, from my inner feelings then from, from \nthinking about the process .]\nS 25: Well, my youngest son wants me to go work (C: Nods.) so that we can have more \n(C: Mhm.) money and so that he can have more spending money.  And, uh, my \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 28 oldest son has not, at this time, agreed to live with me yet. ( C: Mmm.) But I’m \npreparing (C: Mhm.) with the hopes that he will at that time. ( C: Mhm.) He is \nliving with… he will be living with me the rest of the summer.\nC 25:  Mhm. So that’s another new part of the…\nS 26:  And my oldest son and I have a very strained relationship.  He hasn’t been living \nwith me the last two years.  And so that’s gonna be another difficult part of what \nI’m talking about ( C: Mhm.)  is, um, at the same time needing and wanting to \nimprove my relationship with Senate ( C: Mhm.) and hoping there’ll be money for \ncounseling. I’m hoping ( C: Mhm.) that we can do work with a third party or in ( C: \nMhm.) a, uh, family group of some sort ( C: Mhm.) because I believe that we’ll \nneed help. (C: Mhm.)  And, uh, so that’s, that, that part of the fall or the coming \nyear scares me too about feeling so alienated from Senate.\nC 26: “Will he, will he really accept me as a mother?”\n[Sylvia: Well, he says, “Will he really accept as a mother” to me that is showing me he is  \nlistening to what I’m saying. ( C: Mhm.)  And that even, um, (pauses) I don’t know if it \nwas or not at that time but it could be very easily have been a, a helper to me to help me \nfocus with what I was, um, wrestling with in terms of understanding or clarifying for \nmyself what I was thinking about it .]\nS 27: (Phone rings) As his mother, ( C: Yeah.) as someone who loves him ( C: Mhm.) and \ncares about him.\nC 27: So that’s a concern to ya, too.\nS 28: (Nods.) (3 seconds pause.) Mhm. And can we get along? Can we live together? We \nhaven’t lived together, and he’s lived in a very different lifestyle.\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 29 C 28: “Can we really form a relationship of the kind that both of us would like?” \nS 29: Pardon?\nC 29: Your asking yourself, “Can we really form a relationship that both of us will like?”\nS 30: (Nods.) Mhm. Yeah, and be happy and, ( C: Mhm.) yeah… (8 seconds pause.)  \n(Smiles.) That’s an important… I hadn’t thought of that on my own, but you \nmentioning my children ( C: Mhm.) brings up the part about Senate, which is a \nvery important part of what I think about. ( C: Mhm.) And I’m happy I’ll have him \nwith us (C: Nods.) during the summer and we’ll be able to have time.\nC 30: You can get a start on that. Mhm.\nS 31: Mhm. Yeah. (C: Mhm.) When I’m not working, (smiles and nods) for example. \n(Pause 24 seconds.)  Well, I felt awfully rigid about this upcoming filming. ( C: \nNods.)  I felt it in my body a lot.  And I feel, I felt more relaxed since we started.\nC 31: Mhm. Mhm. (Pause 4 seconds.) It’s a really difficult thing.\nS 32: Mhm. (Pauses.) Right, and just the same it’s exciting ( C: Mhm.) to come (C: \nMhm.) on this trip and to see you again (C: Mhm.)  and it’s also frightening a lot. \n(C: Mhm.)  Ya know, who’s gonna see it? And what are they gonna think? ( C: \nMhm.) And what’s it gonna look like? ( C: Mhm.)  Am I, am I being hard on \nmyself or am I being good to myself? I don’t know - to put myself in this position \n(C: Yeah.) is what I mean.\nC 32: Yeah. (Pause.) You have quite a little of conflict about, “Should I really be doing \nthis?  Who, who will see it? ( S: Nods.) What will they say?  Am I wise?” \nS 33:  Uh-huh. What’s it gonna be? What’s the finished project,   gonna be? (C: Mhm.) \n(Clears throat.)  Will I ever see it? (C: Mhm.) (Both smile.) (10 second pause.)  \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 30 [Sylvia: To put myself in a position, um, where I’ll be… I was disclosing very private \nthings about myself where other people, I have no idea who all, may be viewing this and  \nmaking their own judgments, and, um, exposing myself, (clears throat) that seems hard \nand, uh, being good to myself, being willing to go through the hardness for the \nopportunity of learning and experience of Carl.  That, I think, is being very good for \nmyself.]\n[Carl: Sylvia has been quite aware of the filming but has had what I believe is a very \ngood attitude toward it.  Uh, that she hopes that by being as natural as she can in the \ninterviews, she’ll be making a contribution to the counseling field.  Both in the interviews  \na year ago and clearly in this interview, the relationship with me has been very important  \nto Sylvia.]\nC 33: (Pause 10 seconds.) Looks to me as though your eyes are saying something, but I \ndon’t know what. (Smiles and laughs.)\nS 34: Well, I’m thinking about how moved I’ve been when I’ve heard your voice a  few \ntimes over the past year.  (C: Hmm.)  And now I’m here.\nC 34: That made a…\nS 35: I wanna take it in – ( C: Mhm.) being here.\nC 35: Mhm. (Pause 3 seconds.) I guess you’re saying that I mean a good deal to you.\nS 36: Well, this time with you. (Nods.) Yes, you, mhm. (Smiles) (Pause 12 seconds) I’m \nthinking about what I want to talk about or I’m feeling kind of empty right now \nabout talking.  (Pause 5 seconds.) \nC 36: Can you tell me what I do mean to you?\nS 37: (Smiles.) Yes, I can. (Pause 8 seconds.) Well, (Pause 4 seconds) I think the best \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 31 thing that I like to think about you is that as I understand your writings, I have not \nread very much that you’ve written, but that you have, that you live what you write  \nabout.  And my understanding of a lot of popular writers are they write one thing \nand somehow they just don’t quite live that.  They live something very different. \nAnd so I think of you as, (laughs) um, (pauses) wonderful in that way and not, \nuh… (Pause 3 seconds.)\nC 37: But what does that mean to you?\nS 38: (Sighs.) (Pause 3 seconds.) Well that it’s what I would like to be more: ( C: Mhm. \nMhm.) to have values and be able to, to do them (pauses) and to live them.\nC 38: (Pause 4 seconds.) You’d like to have a good match between your life (S: Mhm.) \nand what you believe ( S: Mhm. Mhm.) and value.\nS 39: (Pause 3 seconds.) And what I also sense about you is, uh, like “patience” isn’t the \nright word, but I see you as being comfortable with yourself so much so that \nwhatever I or anyone else says or does, doesn’t (pause 3 seconds) get you uptight.\nC 39: (Laughs.)\nS 40: (Laughing.) And maybe it does. ( C: Mhm.) Sometimes it probably does ‘cause \nyou’re a human being.\nC 40: It certainly does, that’s right.\nS 41: But it doesn’t seem like it does ( C: Mhm. Mhm.) too much.\n[Carl: I really was not quite accepting of her, uh, of her feeling that, uh, in the \nrelationship I clearly was not uptight.  It strikes me that what she’s saying here is, uh, \npractically a, uh, statement of the, uh, attitudes that, uh, we have found most effective in \ntherapy.  She’s saying that she experiences me as being genuine.  Uh, she experiences me  \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 32 as caring about her.  Uh, and I think it’s quite clear that she feels that I understand her \nempathically.  And those are the elements that, uh, both in experience and in  research \nhave shown up as being the most, uh, potent elements in a counseling relationship .]\nS 42: And I like that. I would like to be more present ( C: Nods.) and, and comfortable \nwith myself so that other people, including my children and so forth and so on, \ncould do what they do, and that I could be able to be a source of support and not be  \npersonally threatened ( C: Mhm. Mhm. Mhm.) by this little thing and that little \nthing.\nC 42: And that, that has meaning to me.  You’d like to be sufficiently accepting of \nyourself, that then you can be comfortable with what your children do or what \nother people do  (S: Nods.) and not, uh, ( S: Mhm.) not feel frightened, (S: Hmm.) \nthrown off balance.  \nS 43: (Nods.) Mhm. And I’ve enjoyed through the year in the few letters that I’ve gotten \nfrom you, your warmth, and interest in me, in my life.  I’ve liked that a lot from \n(C: Mhm.) you. And at the time those letters were written we had no plans to ( C: \nNo.) make a movie ( C: No.) or all that stuff so that was really enjoyable. (Pause 5 \nseconds.) Do you feel answered well?\nC 43: Yeah. Mhm. Mhm.  (Pause 15 seconds.)  And I’m interested enough in you to \nknow of any other things in your life that are important to you or that, uh, that are \ndifficult for ya, or whatever.\nS 44: (Pause 15 seconds.) Well, I’d like to go one of two ways. I don’t know which yet.  \nUh, one way would be back to the single working mother business.  I’m not sure \nwhere we might go with that, but I know it’s a big thing for me.  And another way \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 33 would be to go with the difficulty I see myself in having with my relationships \nwith men. (C: Mhm. Mmm.) (Pause 3 seconds.) I do so much analyzing (smiles) \nthat I, I feel like throwing up my hands. “What’s the use of even talking about it?”  \nBut I…\nC 44: But you do have ( S: I…) difficulties in…\nS 45: Yeah. I’ll, I’ll go with the men.  ( C: Okay.) And that’s the most frightening thing \nfor me to talk about ( C: Mhm.) on this film because people that I know will \nprobably be seeing this ( C: Mhm.) and men that I know.  (4 second pause.) I see \nmyself, uh, and this, this is real scattered in my mind. (Sighs.) Scattered, (smiles) \nand looking every which way. ( C: Mhm.) Well, I see myself making acquaintance \nwith men, many men, I mean not just one man ( C: Mhm.) and spending some time \nwith that person.  And then, um, feeling that they lost interest in me or that I turned  \nthem off.  And I tell myself things like, “You can’t expect every man you meet to \nfall in love with you.” ( C: Mhm.) And, um, let’s see, (smiles) what else? ( C: But \nyou feel that you…) Oh and then I’ll tell myself all these reasonable… “Of course \nthis man doesn’t like me because I’m this and I’m that and.…” But, I don’t very \noften feel the disappointment and confusion about “Well I had a good time with \nthat man.”  And it seems to me like he must not have had a good time with me \nbecause I didn’t hear from him again, or I did and things went such and such a \nway.  And, uh…\nC 45: Sounds like it seems kind of mysterious to you. (S: Uh-huh.) Why the men lose \ninterest in you.\nS 46: Uh-huh. And then I have feedback from one person, one man friend of mine, who \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 34 says that I create, ya know I turn people off, men, myself.  And so it’s like it’s all, \nit’s all my doing anyway. ( C: Mhm.) But I have felt lately impotent about how to, \n(Pause 7 seconds.) how to have a successful long rel- long lasting relationship with  \na man.  Successful, I don’t mean perfect, I mean ( C: Yeah. Mhm.) workable. ( C: \nMhm.) And, uh, I think workable is successful ( C: Mhm.) these days. (Smiles.) \nYeah.\nC 46: Well, that’s a part of your life in which you just haven’t had the kind of, um, \nsuccess that you wish you had had.  Mhm. Mhm. An important lack in some way.\nS 47: (Nods.) Now I’m remembering we talked about this before.\nC 47: A little bit.\nS 48: A little bit, right. (Sighs.)  (Pause 7 seconds.) And I do that, the kind of analyzing \nthat ‘”Well I have all these habits like, uh, I, um, I like to be by myself, I’m not \nreal generous and outgoing ( C: Nods.) and taking care of, of people that I meet.”  \nAnd the woman that I live with says that she doesn’t see me doing that at all like, \n“Oh come in I’ll fix you dinner, I’ll do this, I’ll do that.” Like I don’t do that. ( C: \nNods)  And, and so I’m confused about do I need to do that to be in a close \nrelationship?  It doesn’t seem to me like I should ( C: Mhm.) need to sell out to be \num enjoyed and wanted.\nC 48: I gather what you mean by “selling out” is that if you, if you really put yourself out \nin kind of an artificial way, you don’t want that.  Is that what you’re saying?\n[Carl: This is a good example of a client experiencing confusion.  And, uh, she tries to be,  \nto talk about it rationally.  But it’s clear that what she is experiencing is just confusion \nitself.  I feel this could have been a better response had I really heard her feeling that she  \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 35 is powerless in, her, uh, relationships with men that she simply doesn’t have what it takes  \nto build a workable relationship. I believe this feeling that, uh, “I have some fundamental  \nlack in myself” is one of the commonest feelings that one meets in counseling situations.  \nAlmost all of us at times feel “there must be some terrible flaw in me or I wouldn’t have  \nsuch problems in my life .”]\nS 49: Yes, if I do all these things for a man, so then he’ll want me.\nC 49: Mhm. Kind of buying his favor, ( S:  Nods. Mhm.) as it were.  And you just don’t \nsee yourself doing that.  Don’t wanna do that.\nS 50: Or wanting to do it. ( C: Mhm. Mhm.) (S: Nods.)  And then I… another question, \nhard question, I ask myself is, “Well, I’m choosing men to relate to that don’t know  \nhow to give in the way that I want to be given to.” ( C: Mhm. Mhm.) And then I try \n(smiles) to figure that one out. ( C: Mhm.)  “Oh simple, I’m choosing, that just \nmeans I need to choose differently.” ( C: Mhm.) And then I look around and it \ndoesn’t seem so simple.\nC 50: Mhm. You say you’re trying to analyze and analyze and analyze what, “what lack \nin me?” or “you know what lack in me?’ I guess your asking yourself mostly, \n“What lack in me keeps, (S: Hmm.) keeps me from having a lasting (S: Mhm.) \nrelationship with men?” \nS 51: And one thing that now I’m recalling that really frightened me was I was talking- I \nlived with my husband for eight years ( C: Nods.) and I felt rejected by him and I \nleft him. (C: Nods.)  And I left him for a man I was very much in love with that \nI’ve been very close to ( C: Mhm.) for five years.  But he’s also… like, I moved \naway from him but I felt left (smiles) by him also.  And so this man friend of mine \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 36 said to me, “Well, what’s wrong with you that you can’t keep a man?” And that, \nuh, that really scared me inside because when I look at the situation in a practical, \nsensible way that doesn’t seem like reality. ( C: Mhm.) But then I don’t know \nmaybe it’s true.\nC 51: But that her saying that ( S: He.) he saying that, ( S: Uh-huh.) uh, really does touch \nsomething in you. “Is there something wrong with me ( S: Uh-huh.) that I….“\nS 52: That I don’t see. (C: Mhm.) And, and, uh, just the fact that it touched me so much \nshows me that there’s something there.\nC 52: Mhm. It, (S: Sighs.) it wouldn’t bother you that much, or you wouldn’t think so \nmuch about it if there wasn’t something in you that that refers to.\nS 53: Mhm. (Nods.) And I, (sighs) I see my mother that way a lot, that my mother not \nbeing able to have a successful relationship with a man and so that’s been my \nmodel and… (Pause 3 seconds) like, why can’t…\nC 53: You’re saying, “Maybe, maybe I’m just following the same pattern as my mother.”\nS 54: Mhm. Well, I am in that respect and I don’t like it. ( C: Mhm.) And I’m not willing \nto do a bunch of crummy stuff that I… ( C: Mhm.) (Pause 6 seconds.) So, right now  \n(smiles) I’m living alone ( C: Mhm.) and I’m not doing any crummy stuff. ( C: \nMhm.)  And I also have some very nice relationships.  It’s (smiles) those shades of \nblack and white.  (Pause 8 seconds.) But I do feel a lot of confusion about building \nan intimate relationship. ( C: Mhm.) A monogamous type ( C: Mhm. Mhm.) or \nprimary…\nC 54: So you can have good times and all that, but still there is this nagging question or \nthese nagging questions, “Am I just following my mother’s pattern?” “What is \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 37 wrong with me that I don’t have a permanent relationship with a man?”\n[Sylvia: I don’t ever recall feeling like Carl wasn’t understanding me or… because if I \ndid have that feeling there was something I could do about it right then and there in \nterms of helping him to better understand me, so then I did feel understood.  His intention  \nwas to very much to be with me and, uh, if I got the sense that he wasn’t that we could \ntalk about that.]\n[Carl: I think this interview is a good example of the fact that, uh, when the relationship \nis good, the client is able to take more and more risks.  Sylvia begins with material which  \nis quite present in her awareness, and yet by the end of the interview she is dipping into \nmaterial which she doesn’t understand, which she’s a little bit fearful of expressing. Uh, \nShe has gone several levels deeper during the interview and to me that’s, uh, the mark of \na process of therapy that in the long run will be successful.  Perhaps through this whole  \ninterview, it’s evident that, uh, following the client’s experiencing, being a companion to \nthe client in whatever, uh, is going on in her does lead to opening up new, uh, areas of \nconcern, new explorations, leads her into new, uh, territories .]\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 38 This transcript is available for purposes of research, study and teaching.

M. (1975). The struggle for self-acceptance. ]\n[Commentaries are typed in brackets and italics to distinguish from the actual interview.]\nCarl Commentary 1: [ This is my fifth interview with Sylvia. The fourth interview had \nbeen held on the previous day. Prior to that there had been the three interviews a year \nearlier. The interview will be shown as it was recorded, but with comments both from \nSylvia and from myself at points where we felt we wished to clarify what was going \non,uh, or to make some comment about what was going on. ] \nCarl: Well, where would you like to start this morning?\nSylvia1: Well, uh, I want to tell you about something that I've been thinking about and \nthat’s it's a, a sharing more than  (C: M-hm.)  telling you a problem.  (C: M-hm.)\nC Commentary 2: [ So often clients and counselors get the feeling that, uh, the \nrelationship is one which must be filled only with problems. Uh, Sylvia gives a little \nindication of that, this is just a sharing, it's not a problem. ]\nS1 (continued):  And that is I’ve just recently noticed in myself that I've been learning. \n(She laughs a little.)   (C: M-hm.)  And that's a big deal. Uh, I hear people say all the \ntime, “Oh, I've learned so much, I learned this and I learned that and that was such a \nlearning experience.” And I, all these years that I've been grown up, I haven't felt any \nlearning, and I feel, “Well, what did you learn and how did you know that you \nlearned it?” And it was a mystery to me.  (C: M-hm.)  And just the last few weeks, or \nactually I've been realizing in the last year mainly is that I’ve learned some things  (C:  \nM-hm.)  and I know I've learned them and I, I know that, okay, that I'm at this point \nand with a certain situation or idea and that six months ago or three months ago it was  \ndifferent.  (C: Uh-huh.)  And so I'm feeling my learning and that's really exciting.\nC Commentary 3: [ A relationship should be one in which good feelings have just as \nmuch place as bad feelings, and here she's bringing out some very positive feelings about  \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 39 herself, which is a healthy and valid part of a counseling relationship. It's always \nexciting to me to, uh, hear a client telling of positive steps which, uh, he or she has been \ntaking, and here Sylvia sounds confident as she's doing something that she has decided to  \ndo in her own way, not necessarily following all the books, but doing what she feels and \nexperiences is right. ]\nC1: And it’s the awareness of it that's new.  (S: Uh-huh. Yeah.)  That you're beginning to \nrealize, “Hey, I am different in this respect,  (S: Uh-huh.)  I've learned something.”\nS2: I've changed.  (C: Uh-huh.)   And I can see the difference and feel the difference. (C: \nUh-huh.)  Yeah.\nC2: What are some of those differences?\nS3: Well,  (small laugh)  um, I, I've made a decision to be more strict with my children  \n(C: M-hm, m-hm.)   and to, uh, to listen to them but decide that I'm their mother and \nI know many things they don't, and that I will make many more decisions than  (C: \nM-hm.)  I've made in the past. And uh- \n \nC3: M-hm, m-hm.  Sounds as though you feel a bit stronger that way.\nS4: Yes. And and I've been trying it.  (C: Uh, m-hm.)  Trying being the more strict person  \nand it's working beautifully.  (C: Uh-huh.)  Uh, they at first they, you know, have \ntheir little resistance or whatever it is but then we go on with the program, which is \nmy program more,  (C: M-hm.)  and I feel a lot better about that as being uh uh \nhelping children to adjust to the world.\nC4: I mean, sounds, sounds like you feel more like a grown-up mother.\nS5: M-hm. Capable.  (C: M-hm.)  Of making appropriate decisions.  (C: M-hm.)   For \nthem. And another area is sex. And, uh, and I, I've done a lot of things in the past \nyear, in the past mainly year that I haven't done before. That is, I've had intercourse \nwith a few different men  (C: M-hm.)  and put myself in situations where before I \nwas absolutely unwilling to do because of my fears and, and I've learned some things  \nabout myself. Like I know a lot more right now today about what kind of sexual \nrelationship, what kind of intimate relationships that I want to have with men and \nthat feels good.  (C: M-hm, m-hm.)   Beca ... and, um, and it only came through, uh, \nrisking I mean there was no, it only became through trying things out, there was no \namount  (C: Uh-huh, uh-huh.)  There was no amount of, of therapy or reading or \nthinking or talking  (C: M-hm.)  that helped me to learn those things,  (C: M-hm.)  \nbut it was feeling strong enough within myself that I can take chances.\nC5: So risking has been the road to learning  (S: Yeah.)  in the sexual area.\nS6:  Uh-huh.  (C: M-hm.)  And it is with my children  (C: M-hm.)  and it is with relating \nto people in many ways, not just sexually.  (She smiles.)  (C: M-hm.) Other ways too.  \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 40 (C: M-hm.)\nC Commentary 4: [ Sylvia is showing a lot of risking behavior. She's risking a good deal \nto talk about things like this on film. But what's more important is that she has come to \nthe point in her own life where, where she realizes that her own experience is the best \nguide for her, not books, not therapy, not anything outside of herself. It is her own \nexperience from which she can learn, and here she is learning in a very sensitive and, uh,  \npersonal area and is willing to share that with us. ]\nS6 (continued):  Reaching out to people and approaching strangers and, uh ...\nC6: Taking all kinds of risks that you hadn't before.\nS7: Some. More,  (C: M-hm.)  which, I mean I, I don't know about all kinds.  (C: Yeah.)  \nQuite a few, and it's been exciting  (C: M-hm.)  and hard.\nC7: And I guess that leads to a, uh, to a deeper kind of learning, or at any rate, a learning \nthat you feel more sure of.  I guess, I get a sense of assurance in what you're talking \nabout. An assurance in you.\nC Commentary 5: [ One thing that has been true with Sylvia in every interview we've had \nis that she thinks carefully about what she says, she thinks carefully about what I say, \nand when what I say is not correct, doesn't match her experience, she's quite willing to \ncorrect me. She is very precise in both describing her own feelings and also in making \nsure that my response to them is also accurate. ]\nS8: Well, yes. Yes and no.  (C: Uh-huh.)  And I ... I ... feel more im...  like I, I was saying  \nbefore, I feel more immature and more and I'm more aware of my immaturity.  (C: \nM-hm.)   They're both, uh, a part of each other.  (C: M-hm.)   And uh, does that \nmake, does that, I guess I'm thinking that it just sounds crazy.\nC8: No, I don't\nS9: To say that I feel more mature because I know I'm how, I know more about how \nimmature I am.\nC9: Uh-huh. No, that makes a lot of sense to me.\nS Commentary 1: [ I was surprised at what I said made sense to him. I think that I \nthought that it made sense to me, but that doesn't necessarily mean it would make sense \nto other people. I mean, it made in my own system of what was said. It felt good that he \ncould understand me and he knew I that, that it made sense to him too. ]\nC Commentary 6: [ It's important to Sylvia to make sure that she's accurately understood.  \nCan anyone understand how she can be more mature by being aware of her immaturity? \nWell, to me, that's quite understandable, but it's clear that she wants to make certain that \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 41 my understanding extends to that degree. ]\nS10: It does.\nC10: Uh-huh. Because you’re, you're uh more aware of all aspects of yourself  (S: M-\nhm.)  and it sounds a more acceptant of them too. “Yes, I'm mature in certain ways  \n(S: M-hm.)  and here's some ways I know I'm immature.”\nS11: And I didn't know that before,  (C: Uh-huh.)  or I, I knew I felt uncomfortable that I \ndidn't understand it.    (C: M-hm, m-hm.)   But that's related to something I've been \nthinking about, I think, about being here with you and, uh, and telling myself two \nthings.  (C: M-hm.)  One is, “Oh, you're just a, I'm just a dependent personality,” \nyou know, Carl Rogers or blah-blah-blah-blah, don't, I don't run my own life.  (C: \nM-hm.)  I go for help a lot.  (C: M-hm.)  And then I tell myself  I’ve always been so \nstrong and so together and having everything so worked out in my head that I don't \nallow myself to, to be helpless in a situation where it might be  (C: M-hm.)   good \nfor me.  (C: M-hm.)  Like right now here with you, I would like to be more helpless,  \nwhich to me means open, I think.  (C: M-hm, m-hm.)  To what to us and, uh, and I \nsee myself being, uh, together and not being helpless.  (C: M-hm.)  \nS Commentary 2: [ I think at that point I was feeling concern that I was just gonna go to \nanother session of being all in control of things and and rattling on and on. I probably \nmade a conscious decision that that I have to do something to, to break that and, uh, \nwhich was talk about it, talk about my fear. My fear was or concern that I wouldn't learn \nanything.]\nC11: Sounds as though you, you voice that as a conflict, but it sounds as though really \nyou're more on the, on the side of the second aspect that, uh, uh, to be open and, \nand in that sense helpless and vulnerable, I guess might be a possible term too, um, \nis something you, you really believe that's what you are, rather than that you're a \ntotally dependent person and really helpless and have to, have to run for help. I sort  \nof get the feeling you like this aspect of you that is able to be with me in a way that \nis, uh, more open, more vulnerable perhaps.\nS12: Well, I like it and I also scold myself for being dependent,   (C: M-hm.)  so there's\nC12: There are the two sides, uh-huh.\nS13: there's something missing in the middle to connect,   (C: M-hm.)  and I it seems like \nyou might have been talking about that and I still didn't hear it.\nC13:  (Nods.)  M-hm.  (S: Mm.)   So really to get it more accurately, you scold yourself \nfor for being dependent, for, for wanting  (S: M-hm.)  to be here, for example, with \nme,  (S: M-hm.)  and yet at the same time you, you feel. uh, well, that's good, I, I \nreally like that, but where's the, where's the integration of those two, uh, points of \nview.  (S: M-hm.)   (Sylvia nods.)\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 42 S Commentary 3:  [ That seemed to me like a very excellent, um, not paraphrase, but \nwhen he, you know, tells me back  (C: M-hm.)  what he thinks I meant, it, um, solidified \nwhat I expressed in the previous comment about that there was something missing. It \nmade more sense to me. ]\nS14: That's right. (small laugh)  (pause of 7 seconds)   May I hold your hands again?\nC14: Sure. M-hm.  (They lean closer and clasp hands and remain holding hands.)\nS15: To feel that old feeling.\nC15: Okay.\nS Commentary 4: [ When we did that filming in A_____, we held each others' hands the \nwhole time, and I imagine that it occurred me that it might be good to do that again. I \nfeel good. At that time, I, I wanted to get away from being in my head so completely the \nwhole time, experiencing. ]\nC Commentary 7: [ I felt very comfortable during this holding of hands. Uh, I'm reminded  \nof a friend of mine who said that he did eye therapy and, uh, in a sense that's what this \nwas. Our eyes were very much in contact, and, uh, I think as much was going on at a \nnon-verbal way as in a verbal way. It was a close relationship, and we both experienced \nit that way.]\nS16: (Clears throat.)  (pause of 11 seconds)   I would like to be less, uh, less strong right \nnow. I would like to give myself the gift of not having to be sensible  (C: M-hm.)  \nand reasonable and (C: M-hm, m-hm.)  Also the protection,   (C: M-hm.)  protect,   \n(C: M-hm.)  protect myself.\nC16: M-hm, m-hm, m-hm. Really would be giving yourself a gift if you could just kind \nof let go  (S: M-hm.)  and not, uh, not be so   (S: M-hm.)  competent   (S: M-hm.) \nand able.  (S: Mm.)  (She nods.)   (pause of 5 seconds)  \nC Commentary 8: [ It seems clear that the reason she wants to hold my hands is that she \nwants to experience something that is very frightening to her, namely to drop her \ncompetent, reasonable, strong self and let herself be some of the weakness and \nvulnerability that she is. ]\nS17:  And I think it helps to touch ( C: M-hm.)  (Carl nods.)  you, to, to, to let go of the \nshoulds,  of my  (small laugh)\nC17: M-hm, m-hm. And you feel some contact and maybe you can say, “Well, maybe I \ndon't have to be so strong, so  (S: M-hm, mm.)   Maybe I can just let go more.”\nS18:  (pause of 5 seconds)  Yes.  (small laugh)  (She sighs.)  ( pause of 22 seconds)  I \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 43 want to get away from all, um, my rationalizing right now this minute, and I don't \nknow how to do that  (C: M-hm.)   except to shut up.  (Carl nods.)  (C: M-hm, m-\nhm.)  And,  (pause of 5 seconds)  so it's not like I have so much a desire to sit and \nnot talk and look in your eyes as I have a desire to not be the way I am all the time.  \n(C: M-hm.)   And I don't know yet  (C: M-hm, m-hm.) what else to do.  (C:  M-\nhm.)\nC Commentary 9:  [In the interviews that we held a year ago, the silences were very long  \nand Sylvia found a, a great deal of security and, uh, seemed to profit a great deal from \nholding my hands during the interview, and here she, uh, returns to the pattern of a year \nago. It's another indication of the fact that these interviews with her perhaps rest more \nsolidly on just the fact of the relationship than they do even on the content of what, uh, \nshe's saying and talking about.]\nC18:  Have to be kind of silent, to let go of that rational and rationalizing part of you.\n \nS19: M-hm.  (pause of 25 seconds)  It feels easier to focus on, uh, in this position that I'm  \nin now with you I feel more focused,  (C: M-hm.)  (He nods.)  yeah.\nC19: Are there any things that sort of come bubbling up?\nS20: Yeah, I know it's something I want to talk about.  (She smiles.)\nC20: Okay.  M-hm.  (pause of 10 seconds)  (She smiles.)  But it's not easy, huh.\nS21: No, it's not easy and I'm enjoying the richness of feeling  (C: M-hm.)   your hands \nthis way and letting go of some more of, of the camera business  (C: M-hm.)  and \nthe ...    (C: M-hm, m-hm.)  And, uh, and the fear about bringing up something that  \n(laughs)  (clears throat)  and knowing that in about fifteen minutes it'll all seem, um,  \n(sighs, smiling)  I don't know not quite as serious.  (C: M-hm.)\nS Commentary 5: [It just had to take its own time for me to get to where I could feel like I  \ncould say the words that I needed to say. It was almost like waiting and just like, uh, you \nknow, what else is new while I'm waiting? For something that took a natural process that  \nit had to take.]\nC Commentary 10:  [If anyone has a doubt about the value of silences, it should be \nremoved by this interchange. Sylvia's saying, “I'm doing more work when I'm silent than \nI am when I'm talking.”]\nS Commentary 6: [His specific comments or the content of his comments is not \nnecessarily helpful as opposed to not helpful, but what it does do that is valuable is that it  \ngives me something to bounce against. It's a stimulation to better focus myself.] \nS21 (continued): There's something I've been wanting to talk over with you.\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 44 C21: Okay.\nS22: Good. I'm real attracted to black people.  (C: M-hm.)  And, uh, that's about the \ncraziest part of me, um, I'm ashamed  (C: Mm.)  Um, I'm embarrassed, not right \nnow this minute, but when I'm out walking around.  (Carl is nodding.)  (C: When it \nhappens, m-hm.)  And living my life.\nC22: You feel what an awful thing it is that I'm attracted to black people.  (S: M-hm.)  \nC Commentary 11:  [I think that from the time that she first wanted to hold my hands, I \nfelt that she probably was going to make use of that closer relationship to get to \nsomething that she hadn't been able to express before, and now she's taking really a \ngreat risk in talking about something very private, very personal.]\nS23: Not, and not all the black people I see  (C: M-hm.)   but a lot.  (C: M-hm.)  And, uh, \nlike the black people that I talked it over with, it seems, it doesn't seem like any \nproblem at all, they understand perfectly.  (C: M-hm.)  And, but my family, I think \nit's a real painful situation for them when I have as many black friends as I do.  (C: \nM-hm, m-hm.)  And-\nC23: That sounds like not only your family looks down on it or something but that you \nscold yourself for it too.\nS24: Uh-huh, right. I, I think there's something wrong with me.\nC24: Yeah, that's it.\nS25: Um. But it doesn't-\nC25: “What kind of a crazy person am I that I feel attracted  (S: Well, sick...)  to so many \nblacks?”\nS26: Sick, sick I think of it as\nC26: Sick, that's \nS27: and ne... neurotic, um.  (C: Hm.)  Strange.  (C: Mm.)  (She closes her eyes and \nclears her throat.)  (pause of 7 seconds)\nC27: You really feel that there's something sick in you that causes you to have so many \nblack friends.\nS28:  (Opening her eyes)  Well, I keep looking for a reasonable explanation  (C: M-hm.)  \nand there is none.  (She laughs a little)\nC28: So there isn't any reason except that you feel that way.\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 45 S29: M-hm. And I ...\nC29: And that isn't good enough.\nS30: Well, I, I, I've been struggling so long to accept that in myself and I'm still fighting. \nIt's like I'm fighting to accept that in myself and, and letting go rather than thinking \nit's a terrible thing  (C: M-hm.)   and and that I can't let other people know.  (C: \nHm, m-hm, m-hm.)   And, uh,\nC30: You feel “I should not feel that way. I shouldn't be that way. Sick.”\nC Commentary 12:   [I think by that response I was trying to exaggerate her feelings in\norder to assist her in, uh, becoming more accepting of them, but as I, uh, listen\nto it I think I might have responded more powerfully by responding to\nher struggle to accept herself as a person who is attracted to blacks.]\nS31: Like when I, wh ... , I imagine when I meet a black person that I am attracted\nto, that that person will know   (He nods.)   (C: M-hm, mm-hm.)   and I always wonder if \nthey can tell.\nC31: Mm, see if it shows.  (S: Uh-huh.)  M-hm, m-hm.\nS32: And that they'll think I'm strange.  (C: M-hm.)    M-hm. And it has something to do \nwith all the black/white sex stuff that goes on, like, um, black women and white \nmen which is very foreign to me, I have very little thinking or, um, concern about \nthat. But the black men/white women thing,   (C: M-hm.)   um. and I'm attracted to \na lot of black men.  (C: M-hm.)  Yeah.\nC32: It has something to do with the sexual attraction.\nS33: I know, yeah, it does, I know it does.  (C: M-hm.)    But it's not just that, it's also  \n(C: M-hm.)   children and and women and lifestyle  (C: M-hm.)   and as I see it \nthrough my tunnel vision, which I do.  (C: Uh-huh.)  (clears her throat)\nC33: So I guess you're saying, um, yeah, there's a sexual element in it but\nI'm also attracted to their way of living.\nS34: M-hm. That I see.  (C: Yeah.)  And I, but I think what I see isn't what is.\nC34:  (He nods.)  That's partly your fantasy or something.  (Sylvia nods.)  (pause of 8 \nseconds)  \nS35: Maybe putting that, that, this on this film will help me that  (She smiles.) stand on \nthe ground and be who I am.  (C: M-hm, m-hm.)  And not be so ashamed, so \nembarrassed and so,  (C: M-hm.)   um, uncomfortable.\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 46 C35: In a way you're saying it out loud and really in a wa ..., in a sense, publicly, may \nhelp you to feel “I don't need to be so ashamed of that.”  (S: M-hm.)\nC Commentary 13:   [I've filmed a number of interviews, but I never had a client \nknowingly make use of the filming to try to gain more acceptance of self and clearly \nthat's what Sylvia is doing in this interchange. By putting herself clearly on record, she \nfeels perhaps then she will feel less ashamed, less sick, more, uh, truly acceptant of the \nperson that she is and the experiences that she has.]\nS36: And I tell myself I should be joyful, I mean,  (C: M-hm.)  (She laughs a little.)  why,  \nwhy negative?  (C: M-hm.)  And I, I guess, you know, the culture or I don't know, I  \n(sighs)  (pause of 6 seconds)  \nC36: But you feel disapproved of probably, certainly by your family and maybe by the \nculture in this respect.\nS37: My friends don't understand.  (C: M-hm.)  My white friends.\nC37: M-hm, m-hm.  (He nods.)  (pause of 10 seconds)  Makes you feel different.  (S: \nHm, hm.)    Set apart or something like that.  (pause of 6 seconds)\nS38: Well, sometimes I feel different but I know a lot of other people, I believe a lot of \nother people feel the same way.  (C: M-hm.)   and I know a lot of other white \nwomen are attracted to black men. So I believe that's common.\nC38: So that somehow you know you're not alone in this.\nC Commentary 14:  [ Here's another example of the fact that expressing all the negative \nattitudes she has toward her own attraction to blacks leads her to realize this really is \nnot so bad after all; there are positive sides of it. Other people, other women feel the \nsame way.]\nS39: But it seems like the strength of my feelings and, uh, the on-goingness and my de ...,  \nmy desire to identify with the black culture and,  (C: M-hm, m-hm)   um, is. is what \nseems out of proportion to me. That I feel out of proportion about it.  (They both \nnod.)\nC39: M-hm. So Okay, other women feel the same way but not to the degree that you do, \nyou think.  (S: M-hm.)  That's kind of out of  (S: M-hm.)  Out of scale.\nS40: Or in general to the degree too, not just man/woman, but  (C: M-hm.)  people. \n(pause of 15 seconds)  Maybe I,  (small laugh)   it'll come a time accepting that part \nof myself.\nC40: Maybe someday you won't be ashamed of yourself for that.\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 47 S41: M-hm. Maybe someday I can be proud of myself.  (C: M-hm.)   And for what I \nbelieve and feel.  (C: M-hm.)  And I'm gradually learning to do that.\nC41: Uh-huh, m-hm. So, perhaps what you are and what you feel will be something you \ncan take real satisfaction in instead of feeling   (S: M-hm.)   how shameful.\nS42: M-hm. And to me it's it's a sign of my growth is being able to do what I'm doing \nwith you now, you'll make a film.  (C: M-hm.)  (She laughs.)  (C: M-hm, m-hm, m-\nhm, m-hm, m-hm.)   It's a real brazen thing to do.  (C: Yeah.)  M-hm.\nC42: Feel this is a risk.  (S: M-hm.)   And that's a sign of learning and of growth.\nS43: M-hm. Well, also it somehow it's a little different from a risk in the sense of some of  \nmy friends say, “A film? Wh... What do you want to do that for?”  I mean, there's \nsuspiciousness about it and … \nC43: M-hm, m-hm.  (He nods.)  So that's seen as another strange part of you.\nS44: Well, not so much, I mean, that's not a\nC44: Not so.\nS45: It doesn't bother me.  (clears throat)  (pause of 11 seconds)  Sometimes I, well, right \nnow  (She laughs and he nods.)  sometimes, I have the sense of talking away what \nwe were talking about and I'm wondering, if I went away, if I withdraw from the \nsubject, uh, what's your perspective? It seems like we were talking about my \nattraction to black people and now we're not. And I'm, I don't know, like did we \nfinish talking about it or did I withdraw?\nS Commentary 7: [My sense is that I was feeling confused about what was going on.]\nC Commentary 15: [I think this is a sample of Sylvia's sharp awareness of her own \nexperiencing. I don't believe that in content we had left the subject of her attraction to \nblacks. But she realizes in herself that somehow she has withdrawn from that. She's, as \nshe says, talked away from it. Obviously, that's because it has been a, a frightening \nsubject to her. Perhaps also because she feels she's gone as far as she can go with it at \nthe present time.]\nS45 (continued): Um\nC45: It's more of your analyzing it, isn't it, trying to think  (She nods.)  about what's \nhappening. “Did I run away from it? Or was I finished with it?”  (S: M-hm.)  Or \ncontinue think about it\nS46: analyze it  (small laugh)\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 48 C46: Instead of asking, “Do I feel as though I'm finished with it?  (S: M-hm.)  Do I feel \nas though I'm escaping from it?”\nS47: I like that. I like your your questions, or comments.  (C: M-hm.)  Do I feel finished?  \n(pause of 10 seconds)  No, I don't, I don't feel, I don't know  (He nods.)  about \nescaping  (C: M-hm.)   and feeling finished, it's\nC47: The feeling is one of uncertainty.\nS48: M-hm.  (She nods.)  (pause of 35 seconds)  Well I I feel like I want to go back and \nlisten to what we just talked about,  (C: M-hm.)  that I didn't hear it very well.  (C: \nM-hm, m-hm, m-hm, m-hm, m-hm.)  And ...\nC Commentary 16: [This is one of the commonest experiences when a person delves into \nareas that are sensitive, where they've exposed themselves in, in ways that make them \nvery vulnerable. Sylvia, like many other clients, hardly knows what she has said because \nit has come so close to her inner feelings, because it’s such a delicate experience. \nIncidentally, this is one point where a wrong response on the part of the counselor can \nbe very frightening and very threatening because her inner self is really very exposed at \nthis point. This inability to remember is the, uh, defense of the self against being changed  \ntoo rapidly. It probably would be very good for her to hear this later and to begin to \naccept more fully what she's just been expressing.]\nC48: “What did I say? What did I feel?” You'd like to have a rerun of it and it\nS49: M-hm. Like I just went jabber-jabber-jabber-jabber.  (C: M-hm.)   And all that.  (C: \nM-hm.)  And so-\nC49: Sounds like you scold yourself for that, as though, “Oh, I just talk talk-talk.”  (She \nnods.)  (S: M-hm.)   It didn't sound like just talk-talk-talk to me.\nS50: It didn't? \nC50: No. \nC Commentary 17:   [Throughout these interviews, my own feelings have been largely \nempathic and caring ones. Here's the first time that I express some other feeling of my \nown. I simply couldn't permit her to scold herself for what she's been doing, and so I \nsaid, “It doesn't sound like, uh, just talk-talk-talk to me,” which was a very real feeling \non my part at that moment.] \nS Commentary 8:  [At that time I had the feeling that Carl was really asking me \nsomething that he wanted to know. Like genuinely interested and concerned about that.]\nS51:  (pause of 6 seconds) Well, I would like to hear it again,  (He nods.)  and it has, it, \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 49 and slowed down somehow,  (C: M-hm.)  and I now  (small laugh)  I could think \nlike taking your hand and looking at you and slowing down.   (C: M-hm, m-hm.)   \nAnd then when I'm slowing--and that's what I want to do ...  (C: M-hm.)  But while \nI'm doing it, I'm scolding myself.  “What are you doing this for?”\nC51: M-hm.  (pause of 5 seconds)  Let me give you a very brief rerun of part of it. You \nwere saying, “I'm ashamed of myself for being attracted to black men. Uh, I know \nmany other women have some of the same feeling, but it seems to me I have that \nfeeling disproportionately strong and uh my family is critical of that, the culture is \ncritical. Um, I'd like to be able to accept those feelings in myself. Maybe I'm \nmaking a little bit of progress along that line, but still it does seem a need to be a a \nstrange part of me that I don't understand.”   (She nods.)  (pause of 10 seconds)\nS52: That's right.\nC52: “And part of that attraction is sexual but I'm also attracted to their children, to the \nway they live, to a lot of things about them.” (S: M-hm.)\nC Commentary 18:  [Sometimes when I show what an accurate listener I am, I feel proud \nof myself and I do in this moment.]\nS53:  And what I, what you said that strikes me the most is it’s the part of me I don't \nunderstand,  (C: M-hm.)   it's a part of me I don't understand.\nC53: It just is, but you can't quite uh can't quite get at the reasons for it. You have to have  \nthe reasons.\nS54:  (Laughs a little)  (pause of 5 seconds)  And I don't know why I have to have the \nreasons,  (C:  m-hm.)  I don't have to explain to anybody.  (C: M-hm.)  So it seems \nlike I don't have to have a reason.  (She smiles.)\nC54: M-hm.  (pause of 20 seconds)  So maybe the intellectual understanding isn't as \nimportant as you thought it was.\nS55: I think the acceptance is what's most important,  (C: M-hm, m-hm.)  my acceptance.  \n(C:  M-hm.)\nC Commentary 19:   [As she has shown throughout the, uh, interview, as she says, she \nanalyzes and analyzes. She has to see the reasons for all of her behavior, and\nnow she's taking a little bit lighter look at that, and realizing, \"I don't have to have a \nreason for every bit of my behavior, I don't have to understand all of it. I can simply \naccept it. Perhaps I can simply accept it.\" I admire Sylvia's courage in being willing to \nvoice the very, uh, intimate feelings she has on film. I believe that both the expression of \nthose feelings will be constructive for her and that the willingness to share them with a \nwider audience will also have a positive effect in her life.] \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 50 C55: “If I could accept it, I wouldn't have to understand in the sense of knowing the \nreasons.”\nS56:  (Nods.)  Or explain to anybody.  (He nods.)  (C: M-hm, m-hm, m-hm.)  M-hm.\nC56: Sounds like that's what you're doing in imagination a lot, trying to explain it to \nsomebody.\nS57: M-hm.  (pause of 25 seconds)  It seems like I'll probably never understand it.  (Both \nnod.)   So I can make life a lot easier for myself by not trying.  (They both nod.)\nC57: M-hm.  (pause of 5 seconds)  It may be one of those things that if you can accept it, \nyou wouldn't need to have all the explanations.  (pause of 9 seconds)  \nS58: Wonder what  (She closes her eyes for a moment, sighs and clears her throat.)   what  \nkeeps me, um,   feeling like I need to justify myself.  (C: M-hm.)  Like that's a more \nbasic\nC58: M-hm. It's a broader statement of it.\nS59: than about a particular view, accepting myself about this and about that.\nC59: M-hm. You would in general feel “I have to justify myself with proper reasons.”\nS60: M-hm.  (pause of 20 seconds)  (smiles)  Well, do you do that? Do you\nC60: I suspect we all do, some.  (S: Yeah.)  M-hm.\nS61: So there's nobody that just  (Both laugh.)  floats along on their  (Both laugh.)  \nintuition. That’s not it either. So what I need is more balance really.  (C: M-hm.)   \nNot that I’m wrong to justify it, but that I can be more, justify it less and feel more,  \n(Both nod.)   (C: M-hm, m-hm.)  and feel comfortable.  (C: M-hm.)\nS Commentary 9: [This experience that I had with Carl is, uh, real special to me and, uh,  \none of the things about it that feels real close to me is the emotional safety I felt with him.  \nThat there was somehow a, a boundary or a fence or a something that, uh, separated the \nspace that I was in with Carl from the rest of the world and inside that space I was very \nsafe and I would not be hurt. I didn't have to have any fear that I would be hurt no matter  \nwhat I said or did, and the focus of my thinking was how very safe that felt. Another thing  \nI felt from him that I think has affected me some over this time is that I felt, uh, like \nsupport from him to be myself, to listen to myself and to respond to myself and to care \nabout, to put myself first. I think about how my life might have been changed by my \nexperiences with Carl. I think Carl's caring for me in the way that he did, his, uh, \nmodeling, helping me to learn to care for myself, where like maybe my most important \nresource would be myself.  (C: Yeah.)  So it seems to me that in his style of relating \nthere's a lot of support to do that, a lot of encouragement and influence to listen to \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 51 myself.]\n END OF SESSION\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 52 This transcript is available for purposes of research, study and teaching. It may not be \nsold. \n \n Kathy Interview by Carl Rogers (Circa 1975)\n[Source: Shostrom, E. L. (1975). Three approaches to psychotherapy II  [Film]. \nOrange, CA.]\nRogers:  I want to meet this client as a person. And I want our encounter to be that \nof two persons. I have no desire to have advance information regarding \nher. I'll work with whatever she wishes to reveal of herself. It's my hope \nthat I can first of all be myself. Be present. Be real in the relationship. I \nusually find it easy, also, to feel a caring for the client. But I can't predict \nin advance whether I will feel that. I would like to let myself enter into her  \ninner world of feelings and perceptions as accurately and as sensitively as \nI can. In order to experience that kind of empathy, I'11 need to lay aside, \nas far as possible, my own biases and preconceptions. The extent to which \nI can do that will to a considerable degree determine the progress which \nshe is able to make in the time we have together. I feel I'm a responsible \ntherapist. I'm responsible for doing my best to create a facilitative climate \nin which she can explore her feelings in the way that she desires, move \ntoward the goals that she wishes to achieve. It's in this deep sense that my \napproach to therapy is centered in the client. Aiming to empower him or \nher to search out and experience the areas of conflict or pain, to perceive \nself in new ways, to choose to follow new options in behavior. It is my \nown self I find feelings other than those of caring and of understanding I'll  \nfeel free to express these; but as my own feelings, not as any judgment of \nor guide for the client. Or, especially on a first interview, I may have no \nother feelings than a prizing of the client and a desire to in-dwell in her \nexperience. There's no way I can tell in advance. For me each encounter \nwith a client is fresh, unpredictable, often enriching to my learning as well  \nas hopefully, enriching the self-learning of the client. So I look forward \nwith eagerness to whatever our time together may bring.\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Kathy, Introduction, page 53 This transcript is available for purposes of research, study and teaching.

And I, I became aware \nthat, after he died especially, that he was really very important in my life.  I \nwas kind of using him as a shield against going out and having other \nrelationships.  And now he’s gone and I can't use that anymore.  And I feel \nvery, very frightened of new male relationships.\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Kathy Interview, page 54T3:So in some way his, his death, uh, really made you aware of the fear you have \nof, of new relationships, especially with men.\nC4:Right, right.  Definitely, I didn't have him.  I didn't have that to hide behind \nanymore.  And, uh, I had a tremendous feeling of loss when he died because I \ndid care for him.  But, um, in going out with other men lately, I just have this \nfeeling of, uh, it's very strange.  I'm very uncomfortable.\nT4:So that, the feeling you have is something more than just the loss of him.  It's \na different feeling, a fee1ing of uneasy or scared or unsure.\nC5:Yes.  For a long time I didn't feel like going out and that was fine.  I was \ngoing through my loss of him, but that was all right.  I didn’t push it or \nanything.  But just recently I started going out and I've been aware for years of  \nhow lonely, I have been very, very lonely.  I haven't been dating very much \nfor the last four years, mostly just working and taking care of the kids.  And \num, I think I'm keeping myself in kind of a no-win situation where I'm really \nlonely.  And yet it's kind of like I'm keeping myself there because I've got a \nguard around me, and I'd kind of like to break out of that.\nT5:It’s as though you're in some way sort of responsible for your loneliness.\nC6:Yes, I know that.  I'm very… I am.\nT6:And that's something you'd like to break out of that shell, or that safeguard \nthat you've been hiding behind.\nC7:Part of me does.\nT7:Part of you does.  Ok, ok.\nC8:Part of me says, “No way”.\nT8:So it really is a very ambivalent, two-way thing. (C takes a breath) I suspect \nit's been pretty comfortable, um, behind that safeguard; it's more of risk if you \nbreak out.  Is that part of it?\nC9:I, I can almost, well I was going to say I can almost go back to the point where  \nI really built up that safeguard in me when my marriage was going bad.  Over \nfive years ago and I could feel myself, and I know I did, I withdrew and I’ve \nbeen withdrawn ever since.  It's kind of like, “No more.  I don't want any more  \nhurt.”  So…\nT9:Uhm, hmm, it's just too damn risky, taking the possibility of being hurt again. \nAnd you've withdrawn from that for a long time.\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Kathy Interview, page 55C10: Uhm, hmm.  See, and I've been aware of this for a long time too, but I never \ngo beyond the awareness level.\nT10: So that the knowledge isn't new, it's the um, question of what you do about it.\nC11:That's right, that's right.  How can one stay safe and still be open?\nT11: The way you shake your head makes me feel, “I don't see any way.”\nC12:I don't, I really don’t.  If I did, maybe I probably would have done it a long \ntime ago, but I don't.\nT12:Just seems kind of unbearable to, to be, open with a person and yet feel safe.\nC13:I, I think I'm a pretty open person to begin with.  And uh, everything is fine in \na relationship as long as the focus does not turn onto me.\nT13:I see, I see.  If you can keep the focus on the other person you're ok.\nC14:That's right.  And the focus on me up to a certain level, but not in the romantic  \nkind of a way.  A friendship, I would value that.\nT14:But love, you want to, keep that at arms length.\nC15:But you know, that's important though, because um, if a person doesn't want \nto really be your friend, how can you have them for a lover?\nT15:Uhm, hmm.\nC16:No way.\nT16:Not quite sure I get that.  You mean friendship is a necessary first step, is that \nwhat you're saying, or…\nC17:     It is for me.\nT17:Yeah.     (Long pause)\nC18:We've gotten to the point where I won't go beyond.\nT18:Uhm, hmm, that's what I was sort of thinking.  You've thought your way this \nfar, but then where do you… \nC19:I've laid the cards out and that's all I want to play.\nT19:So that, in this relationship it's like in your other relationships.\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Kathy Interview, page 56C20:That's right.\nT20:It goes so far and then, “Let's stop.  That's as far as I want to go.”   (Pause)      \n(C: Hmm.)  If you go any further, there's a risk, isn't it?\nC21:Yes, it is.\nT21:And I think your eyes tell me you're feeling that risk right now.  (Pause)\nC22:So here I am.  (Pause)  I feel like saying to myself, “Well you got this far.  It's \nnot so bad.” (Laughter)  It's all right; I make the best out of it.\nT22:It's all right up to this point.\nC23:Yeah, right.\nT23:So let’s laugh it off.\nC24:Yeah, make a joke.  Talk about something else.\nT24: Could, very easy to run away from yourself.\nC25:See, but that's it.  I made a bargain with myself.  There's two parts:  the part \nthat understands and it’s all right, and the other part that's scared silly.  But the  \npart that understands isn’t going to force the part that's scared.  When it’s safe \nenough, I'll be kind to myself.\nT25:And let the scared part come out when, when you’re ready for it, when…\nC26:When the scared part feels ready.  It’s as if part of me is in a cave away from \nthe rest of the world.  But it cert-, I certainly can't come out of that cave, \nunless I know that it’s all right, that there won't be a lot of pain to greet me.   \nWhat's the sense in coming out?  So it’s up to the best of me to make sure that \nthere are nurturing people around me.\nT26:And when you feel safe enough, either in this relationship or with other \npeople, then you can let yourself come out of the cave and let the scared part \nof you emerge.\nC27:That's right.  That's why, that's why I value the friendships with men and with \nother people.  I don't care for the rest.  Not to say that I don't need it, I do, but \nI need the friendship, and the safety and the security of that first.  I, um, took a  \ntrip not too long ago and I met a man that I had known years and years ago, \nonly very briefly.  And I met him again I went out with him.   And he was \nsuch a lovely person, such a kind person, and a very ... a very good person.  \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Kathy Interview, page 57Anyway, it was in the mountains and as I was driving home from his, um, his \nhome, looking at the mountains, I, I had this feeling.  It’s kind of funny, I \nhaven't read the Carlos Castaneda books, but I know the concept of the third \neye.  And I was feeling as I was driving through those mountains that, “Now \nit’s all right for my third eye to come out, and to be able to perceive.”  And I \nfelt so good. But when I came back home, I've kind of busied myself with \nwoodworking, and the house, and that kind of thing.  And I'm kind of back in \nthe same environment, in the same predicament.  But I know that I, I \nconsciously at times choose between focusing in on things and not.\nT27:I'm, I'm really interested in that experience, when you were away from him, \nthen there was just a little while, when it felt safe.  And you could perceive… \nC28:When I was driving. \nT28:Yeah, when you were driving and you could perceive yourself and the whole \nsituation, I guess.\nC29:I could perceive, it doesn’t have much to, it did have to do with him, but I \ncould perceive myself, and my closed-offedness.  And at that time I was open,  \nand I had that perception of myself and that awareness that I had been closed. \nAnd that, when I was driving through that canyon I was feeling very open and \nnow I could have my understanding, and it was a1l right. \nT29:You let yourself for that time come out of the cave.\nC30:Yeah, yes, it was great.  And then he came to see me.  He flew in to see me a \ncouple of weeks ago.  And um, I felt, see I was aware I had this memory of \nthat opening up and so I felt more guarded.\nT30:Ah, is that right.\nC31:But kind of slowly unpeeling layers, or slowing coming up.\nT31:But somehow, having, having come out of the cave, you were afraid you \nmight come out of the cave too easily.\nC32:Too, yeah that's right, that's right.\nT32:“So, watch out, be careful”.\nC33:That's right.\nT33:You sound like a very tender, vulnerable part of you that lives in that cave.\nC34:I think my most tender part. (C cries)\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Kathy Interview, page 58T34: Your most?\nC35:My most tender part.\nT35:Your most tender part. Uhm, hmm. Uhm, hmm. Uhm, hmm.  It's really a very \nprecious part of you that you keep in the cave\nC36:(C takes long breath)  I, for a long, long time, I’ve had the feeling of \nhopelessness of ever coming out.  And do you know life is an existence \nwithout all of you… \nT36: Without?\nC37: …all of you.\nT37:Yeah, I see.\nC38:Right.\nT38:So, you, the hopelessness, I gather is because you know you're not living with \nall of you.  Part of you you're keeping well hidden.\nC39:That's right.\nT39:Well guarded.  And it isn't really living, unless you can live it with all of you.\nC40:That's right, it's just doing things, just doing things.  The part that, you know, \nthat I consciously avoid are the arts.  The things that I love, music, theater, \npaintings, that kind of thing.\nT40:Those are the things that touch your feelings.\nC41:I don’t get to the core.\nT41:Ok, things that touch your feelings or touch the core of you, those you want to  \nstay away from.\nC42:That's right.\nT42:They got, they get too close, too close to this very tender part of you.\nC43:(Pause) I’ve reached another stop.\nT43:Uhm, hmm, but you felt safe enough to let out a little bit more and now it’s \ncome to another stop. \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Kathy Interview, page 59C44:(Pause) I have to give equal time to all of my dimensions.  We just have, I just  \nfelt, you know, in touch with my vulnerability, but now I’m feeling angry.\nT44:Ok.\nC45:Like, “It’s none of your business…”\nT45:Uhm, hmm.\nC46:…what I'm feeling.\nT46:Uhm, hmm, what am I doing getting that close to the vulnerable part of you?  \n“Damn it, stay away.”\nC47:That’s right, that’s right.  What do you want to do that for?\nT47:Uhm, hmm. Uhm, hmm.\nC48:You've got other things to do. (C laughs)\nT48:So you’re putting up all kinds of guards against me, and striking out, “What \nthe hell are you doing”, and, “getting so close to the vulnerable part of me, \nwhy don’t you go do something else”, hmm?\nC49:     That's the part that keeps me lonely.\nT49:Uhm, hmm.  So that, that pushing away part, that kind of angry, “Get away \nfrom me” part, is what keeps you very lonely.\nC50:It's like I don't really trust that I can trust you to know that.  I can tell this and \nthat.  You may feel a little something about it, but what then?  You know, I \nmean you know, “It's a nice story, so, big deal, something else to do”.\nT50:What I hear is that, is that you feel that I don’t really care, just a story… \nC51:That's right.\nT51:Just something… but what if I do …\nC52: You know…\nT52:But what if I do care.\nC53:(C takes a breath) I want to make a joke and say, \"Aw, go on.\" (C laughs)  \nYou know, um, I'm a nurse and, a psychiatric nurse, worked in a psychiatric \nhospital last year.  One of the big things there, the patients got a lot of points if  \nthey would talk in group.  I mean everybody wants you to talk.  You know, \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Kathy Interview, page 60the good patient talks.  And I thought, you know, anybody can talk. The \nreason why people don’t talk is not because they can’t talk, it’s because they \ndon't know how people are going to respond. That's where it’s at. So I don’t \nthink the patients were not being good patients. I don't think they were being \nbad patients because they weren't talking. I think that the staff should have a \ndemerit for not responding. Ok, these patients talked, now how do you \nrespond?  Makes it a whole new ballgame.\nT53:Yeah.\nC54:And so now, I talked. (C laughs)\nT54:You've earned some points.\nC55: Yeah now I earned my points, that's true.  But, um, I think that’s the fear of \neveryone.   It’s not so much revealing themselves, but being cared about.  \nThat's my fear.  That's my fears after I've revealed myself, “Who cares?” \nT55:It's uh, when you've let out a tender part of yourself, then it’s damned \nimportant to know, “Does this other person care?  Does it make any \ndifference?”\nC56:My husband used to say he cared, but it was just words, it was words.  He um,  \nI think he cared as much as he could care but, he had so many conflicts inside \nof himself that he didn't even see me as a person. Didn't even see me. It's not \nthat he didn't want to care. It's that he couldn't, he was too busy with himself. \nBut I understand that. And I understand that with other people, too. But see I \njust can’t go around revealing myself all the time to people who are just too \nbusy with themselves.\nT56:Uhm, hmm.  You need a response, you need a caring, you need to make a \ndifference to somebody.\nC57:That's it, not to someone who’ll say, \"Oh, well, Kathy, I really care,\" and then \nI don't see them for a couple of years. Or, \"I'll call you\" and then they never \ncall. You know, when I first split up from my husband, I would go to these \ndifferent functions, not with a date, but with friends, and meet a man and he'd \nsay, \"I'll call you\".   And for a while there I'd be sure that I wasn't home, \nbecause I couldn't stand to know if he didn't call.  And that way I didn't know \nif he didn't call, so there was a possibility that he had called.  But I wasn't \nhome, so how could I know. So with that, that, that vulnerable I was really in \ntouch with it. \nT57:It makes so much difference to you to know whether the other person is going \nto really respond.  “When they say they care, do they care?” \nC58:That's right, caring people, will call you, or drop by, “How's it going?”, that \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Kathy Interview, page 61kind of thing.\nT58:And that's not enough?\nC59:No, it would be enough, if they would do that. (C laughs)  That'd be just great,  \nthat would be just great.  I don't think I really want that much from another \nperson.  The morsels are fine, but I'm not even getting the morsels.\nT59:Uhm, hmm, it isn't as though you want a whole meal, it's that…\nC60:Yeah, I mean I could work up to it all right.  That's why I think with this \nfriend it was nice.  And may have gone back in but I felt myself, come alive a \nlittle bit.  A little bit of magic had come into my life, and that was nice.  And \nI'd rather not come out all at once and run back in.  I'd rather come out bit-by-\nbit and stay out. But see the thing of it is that, and like we're talking now, a \nlittle bit, or I'm thinking about the focus of the relationship, it has to be this \nmale-female kind of thing.  And, um, I don't think that what I need to do is to \ncome out and have love, and then, think about a male-female relationship. But  \nI don't know how I can come out too much without a man (C laughs).\nT60:That's kind of a, contradiction, in a way. A dilemma, it's a dilemma. (T \nlaughs)  But you feel what you want first is a relationship with a person, only \nit helps if it’s a man.\nC61:That's right.  It must be a man. Or… \nT61:It isn't just better if it's a man, it's a necessity.\nC62:It must be a man, that’s right, because that's where my fear is.\nT62:So that's where you fear is, a fear of a relationship with a man.  And yet, you'd  \nlike to be able to really come out of the cave first, before it became a man-\nwoman, sexual relationship, or anything like that.  Is that what you're saying?\nC63:I'd like to have a caring relationship.  And its kind of funny, it's like a little girl  \nwanting a man to take her out of the cave, and, care about.   I'll put it back on \nme, I feel like a little girl.  Someone to care about me and to know that I'm \ncomfortable and that I'm all right, and then ask for himself.\nT63:And then ask?\nC64:For himself, of the relationship.\nT64:But first, you'd like to have a man come at least to the entrance of the cave \nand take the hand of you as a little girl and lead you gently out, caring for you.  \nThen maybe, other kinds of things might happen.\nC65:(Pause) The little girl is the non-sexual, being.  That's right, “Don't use me \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Kathy Interview, page 62sexually first.  And then if you like it good enough, keep coming back.” That's  \nwhat I don't want.\nT65: The little girl, the little girl will grow up if you care enough, for her.\nC66:That's right, and can respond as a woman, if the other is there.\nT66: Can you tell him that? Could you tell him that?\nC67:I'm confused, do I tell one man that, or is that what I… \nT67: I was thinking of this, this one man.\nC68:Oh, this individual. \nT68:Uhm, hmm. \nC69:Oh, I think I could tell him that, I know I could.  But you know, I start putting \nhim down.  (T laughs)  I know that's just, my sister told me, she said, “That's \njust because you're scared.”  Because I told her the kind of man I would, I \nthought I would be comfortable with, and he is this kind of person.   And then \nI start telling her all these bad things. And she said, \"Nobody would be \nperfect. You would do this with anyone, some.\"  But with this person I think I \ncould.\nT69: Maybe you could let him know what you need.\nC70:I'd like to be able to carry that over.  I suppose maybe, maybe I'm glossing \nthat over or something, but I'd like to carry it over in my relationships with \neveryone. To get what I need from the relationship, and not focusing in on the \nother person.  See, I think the way I am I'm the perfect nurse, the perf-, you \nknow, anything for somebody else.  And that's fine, focus in on them any \ntime. But on myself, like I'm too scared to do that.  Like that's a no-no.  But I'd  \nlike to be able to do that, focus in on my own needs, first.  But I feel kind of \nselfish when I look at it that way.  I fee1 like a taker instead of a giver and \nthat's got a negative, connotation.\nT70:You're so much a nurse that when you even think of saying, “But I need this \nfor myself.” that seems kind of wrong, selfish.\nC71:“Wait a minute, you're the nurse.  What is this?”\nT71:“You're supposed to be caring for the other person.”\nC72:That's right.\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Kathy Interview, page 63T72:But once in a while you realize, “I'd like to care for myself, first.”([Pause)\nC73:Seems awful. (C laughs)\nT73:Just to say that. \nC74:“You're so naughty, just thinking about it.” (C laughs)\nT74:Just to say that, seems, “What a selfish person I am.”\nC75:Yeah.\nT75:“Terrible, awful.”\nC76:I feel wicked, but I enjoy it.  I'm enjoying thinking about it.\nT76:It's fun just to imagine, “I might want something for myself, first.”\nC77:It's really a lovely fantasy to be completely narcissist, completely self-\ncentered, and into pleasure, and into comfort. (C sighs)\nT77:Just being good to yourself.\nC78:But in a way, you know, in a way I am being good to myself by keep that \nvulnerable part of me away until it's safe.  Because not everybody would be \ngood to you, not everybody would be kind.   There are people who would use \nyou up, and not bat an eyelash, and not even think about it.\nT78:So you have a real respect for your, for your instinct for preserving yourself.\nC79:That's right.\nT79:You can't trust everyone, not everyone would care.  (Pause)\nC80:I was just smiling, I was thinking, but I care.\nT80:And you say that with a smile, but that's pretty deep too isn't it?\nC81:Uhm, hmm.  I do care.\nT81:“I care for myself”.\nC82:I like caring.  I like it.  I like caring for myself, and not giving away every part  \nof my, just because some Tom, Dick, or Harry wants it.\nT82:“I really prize myself, and I'm proud of that.  I'm not going to just give myself \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Kathy Interview, page 64away.”\nC83:That's right.  It's nice to have that feeling of caring for myself, that's good.  \nBut you know since Dick died, I was thinking, I could die tomorrow.  Any of \nus could, and, I'm missing, I want to have more.  I don't want to just care for \nmyself, I want to, I want to be able to care for myself and at the same time be \nable to take in life more.  But I'm not doing, see I've closed it off, if I could \nfigure out some way of doing that, then, you're smiling (C laughs), so that'd be  \njust great.\nT83:To be able to care for yourself, and yet open yourself up to life, and somehow \nthat also tied up with the realization that, “You know, death will come one \nday.”   You'd like to live before you die.\nC84:That's right, I want, I saw a card one time that said, “Born, and then died.”  \nAnd you open it up and it says, \"In between, he lived\" or something like that. \nThat's what I would like for myself, a little life in between the born and the \ndeath, a little more life, and pleasure.  See that's what I'm missing.  Deep \ndown inside is the, pleasure, experience of pleasure and joy, those kinds of \nexperiences.  I've been happy.  I have fun.  I do enjoy my children, but it's on \na limited level.\nT84:You don't really open yourself to joy.  I guess fun, yes sure.\nC85:But joy is on a deeper level, you see, so…  I want to say, \"But how've you \nbeen lately?\" (C laughs).\nT85:Well, “Lets change the subject.” (T laughs).\nC86:Yes, “How's your wife, your house?” all that.\nT86:Um, it'd be pretty nice to just, run away from some of this.\nC87:It would, yes.\nT87:Just talk.\nC88:Well let’s just have a rest for a while.\nT88:I'm impressed with the fact that when you need a rest, you really take it.\nC89:Oh, thank you.  I was thinking my humor comes to the rescue, “Give me a \nbreather.” \nT89:It's one of the ways in which you preserve yourself.\nC90:That's right; I had a dream one time.  And I dreamed that I was on a sled with \ntwo other girls, and we were going down a snowy hill.  And we were going \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Kathy Interview, page 65too fast.  And I told them to stop, they had to get off, otherwise they were \ngoing to crash into this train station at the bottom of the hill.  And they \nwouldn't believe me.  So I got off, and they went on.  And I side-stepped in \nthe snow all the way down the hill, but there were lots of trees where I was \nside stepping, and I was hanging onto the trees, one by one as I went down.  \nAnd when I got to the bottom of the hill, the sled had crashed, or something.  \nAnd then I thought to myself, “That means, that has to do with me.  Part of me  \nwould go too fast, and…” \nT90:And, and this morning has been an example of the fact that you're not going to  \ngo so fast that you crash. (C: That's right.)  You're going to go at your own \npace if its step-by-step down the hill, oh, that's the pace you have.\nC91:That must be it.\nT91:Maybe that's a good stopping point. \nEND\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Kathy Interview, page 66Rogers’ Post-Session Commentary\nI found it fascinating, the way in which this client very slowly lowers \nher defenses. I think those defenses could be broken through, but that in my \nestimation would not be as helpful as letting her proceed at her own pace. I \nthink the client learns more that way. We did progress in the interview. We \nwent from her perception of loneliness as her problem, to her fear of her \nrelationships with men, to her feelings about letting the tender, vulnerable part  \nof herself come out of a cave, to the recognition of the little girl in her that \nwants to be tenderly let out. She then began to get to the recognition of the \ndeep, of the pain that is deep inside of her. That is unspeakable, almost \nunbearable. We saw her partially experience that pain, in spots, and then draw \nback. Then finally we saw the feelings that she has, that perhaps at bottom she  \nis completely unlovable, one of the commonest feelings that people have. I \nthought that the dream at the end was almost a perfect description of the hour. \nShe went deeper into herself, step-by-step, by slow degrees, cautiously and \nguardedly because she didn’t want to crash into that pain. And she took \nresting times between the steps. So I thought that described the whole \nprogress of the hour. I feel that it was a working interview, not highly \ndramatic, and much of therapy is work, and this was a good example of it. I \nfelt present to her.  I felt a companion in her exploration. If I were to continue \nto see her I think that she would gradua1ly move toward experiencing that \ncare of herself of which she is quite frightened. I like the way we got into \nmetaphors. Clients can say more in metaphors then they can say, than they \ndare to say openly. And I like the way I responded to the metaphors.  I liked \nthe way she was able to express her anger toward me whenever she felt it, \nwhenever she felt that she was close to a dangerous part of her experiencing a \npainful part of her experiencing and that was easy for me to accept that anger. \nI felt good about this as a first interview.\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Kathy, Post-Session Commentary, page 67This transcript is available for purposes of research, study and teaching.

What things do you feel you want to talk about today?\nC 3:   I don't know. I was sitting in the room and waiting, before, and I was thinking \nabout when I was about 7 or 8 years old. I remember reading a book, I believe. \nAnd I can't recall the name, by Jung, I think it was. I recalled that when I was \nreading it, at that time, I used to go down in the basement of my home and um, turn  \noff all the lights. And in a way, that was kind of closing the outside world out (C: \nMhm, hmm) and concentrating on what I wanted to do and what I wanted to be. \nAnd at 7 years old I was into that, and today I'm in the same position . . . um, really  \nat this, you know, trying to find out what I want to do, what I want to be. And um, \nI've learned a lot of things. I've learned a lot of things since I found out that I have \nleukemia (T: Mhm, hmm) which is about a year ago this June . . . and I've learned \nan awful lot of things.\nT 3:    I'll bet. And you're going through a stage if I understand is a little bit like what it \nwas at seven, sort of shutting out the world or shutting yourself into a space where \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 1st Interview, page 68you're trying to figure out what it is that you want or who you are?\n[Rogers’ voice over a stopped image Commentary 1: Clearly he has rehearsed this first \nportion and yet, the material is of interest. Whether it's superficial or deep, I want to \nunderstand the exact meaning his experience has for him. Whether it's true or false, real \nor imaginary, this kind of presenting material is very common in first sessions, and is to \nbe expected and to be respected. ]\nC 4:   I think that I've listened for so long to other people about who I was (T: Mhm, \nhmm) and I remember in 2nd grade I was a potential credit to my race. That was \none of the . . . (T: Mhm, hmm) I used to wonder why I couldn't be a credit to \nsomebody (T: laughs) else's race also. I think I was really conditioned to be \nsomething. To be some kind of a symbol, or (T: Mhm, hmm) whatever, and not \nreally being a person, you know, I kind of missed out on my childhood to an \nextent. (T: Mhm, hmm) I don't really regret it. I don't think I regret it anyway, but \nI've really been through a lot of changes. And I think that now, after finding out I \nhad leukemia and after dealing with the leukemia in the way I did, it's just really \nincredible, you see. It was last June when I found out, and um, I proceeded to get \neverything in order because I was told that I had less than a year to live. (T: Mhm, \nhmm) And uh, that was the trip. (T: I'll bet.) That was a trip.\nT 4:   A trip into a fairly dark place, I suppose.\nC 5:   Oh, yeah. For sure. For sure. On one hand I accepted the death. I, you know, at my \nyoung age I think I've lived long and a great deal. But that was the start of some \nthings that really has had an effect on me today. (T: Mhm, hmm) I'm much happier \nthan I've ever been . . . today. (T: Hmm) I'm much happier. (T: Hmm) But there's a \nlot of hurt too. There's an awful lot of hurt and I think I'm just beginning to realize \nthat. Um, because you know, in being a credit to your race, in being an outstanding  \nstudent, an outstanding scholar, an outstanding football player, whatever; it leaves \nyou little room to be . . .\nT 5: You've been meeting other people's expectations of you and it seems that that's what \nyou should do now. I guess you're really questioning that very much.\nC 6:   Oh, yeah. Tremendously. And like you get into . . . the fun thing about it is that I'm \nfinding out that some of the things that I think inside of me are okay. And like that \nisn't . . . you know, I feel okay, and I'm in a process of becoming okay. But like I \nhaven't worked it out. Hurt is a hard thing to deal with. And like conditioning \nyourself to die (T: Mhm, hmm) is another thing, you know, you see, I didn't let my \nfamily in on that (T: Hmm) until March of this year. So it was some months before \nI . . .\nT 6:  You carried that within you.\nC 7:   Oh, yeah. But I proceeded very meticulously to carry out a plan, where my children  \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 1st Interview, page 69would live in an area that I wanted them to live. And that, I was trying to control \nsomething after I died. Only when I went back this year in March to celebrate my \nchildren's birthday, and I had four weeks, incidentally, to live at that time; I was \ntold on March 15 that I had four weeks to live. And it was really incredible because  \nlike, for the first time, I saw all my relatives and my friends. And they were coming  \nin and they were very loving, very loving people, and very kind, you see. Um, but \nat the same time, they were all throwing flowers on my grave. (T: Mhm, hmm) \nAnd I don't think they knew that. And as a result, I got worse and I got worse, and \num, I took a friend back. You see, I'd lived out here in California. um, after I found \nout that I had leukemia, I proceeded to develop a plan to move my family out here. \n(T: Mhm, hmm) And we moved out in approximately November after several trips \nout in the area. The trips were basically to find a doctor (T: Mhm, hmm) and also \nfind in a way some kind of a hope. You see, (T: Mhm, hmm) I have this \nconditioned thing about being a fighter. So, on one hand I accept that, (T: Mhm, \nhmm) and on the other hand I was trying to do all I damned well could to live.\nT 7:   If it's going to be death, okay, you'll take it. But you're not going to take it \nunnecessarily.\nC 8:   No. Not at all.\n[Rogers Commentary 2: I like the way I'm being a companion to him, trying to discover \njust how the prospect of death seems to him. I find that important because a client needs \nmost to be understood in the darkest portions of his experience. ]\nC 9:  You know, the thing that uh, you know, after I was sitting in there and I was \nthinking . . . I had really conditioned myself to, to really get ready and find the \nnearest cross and crawl up on that, and I've been doing that since I was seven years \nold, and I'm not sure why.\nT 9:  To really crucify yourself, is that what you're saying? Or to be a martyr? I'm not \nreally sure . . .\nC 10: Oh, I'm not really sure. But I think the activities I was involved in, in terms of \ntrans-racial communication, (T: Mhm, hmm) working with groups, and helping \npeople (T: Mhm, hmm) I would hope very similar to what people like yourself did. \n(T: Mhm, hmm) Um, always being available for everybody, all the time. (T: Mhm, \nhmm) I think that's being a martyr or (T: Yeah) something. Yeah.\nT 10: Putting the other person first.\nC 11: For sure. Yeah. Instead of saying, \"Hey, there's some time for me.\" Because you \nsee, I worked so hard and so long that it was just really, really difficult for me to \nget used to, you know, being sick, not working' and not being in control (T: Mhm, \nhmm) because I definitely was not in control. (T: Mhm, hmm) And there were a lot  \nof things that I did that I am not really very pleased about. (T: Mhm, hmm) But you  \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 1st Interview, page 70know, after thinking about it for just a little while, or whatever, one of the things I \nmiss you know, I guess maybe from not telling people or whatever, about I was ill .  \n. . but uh, after I told them, some months later, when I had four weeks to live, I \ndidn’t find anybody that allowed me to be desperate, that could understand some of  \nthe things that I didn't want to do. (T: Mhm, hmm) And that brought on another \nguilt trip. (T: Mhm, hmm) And so now I'm in the process of kind of washing all \nthat stuff out.\nT 11: Mhm, hmm. Is that part of the hurt? You referred earlier to hurt and I didn't quite \nunderstand that. (C: Mhm, hmm) I can understand the feeling of desperateness and \nalso I can understand how hard it would be to have no one really understand that \nfeeling in you.\n[Rogers Commentary 3:  I can let him feel desperate. Friends and family cannot allow \nthis. It's important that someone can really permit it. I also go back to his earlier feeling \nof hurt, I wanted to get a more complete feeling for his inner world but he, as you will \nsee, doesn't pick up on this particular portion. ]\nC 12: I've lost my father-in-law, which was a terrible loss to me, and it was a loss that I \nnever could talk to my wife or anybody else about. (T: Hmm. Mhm, hmm) And I \ngave a lot to that family, you know, for five or, I don't know, seven years I guess. \nAnd when I went back, there were just some things that happened that they showed  \nme there wasn't, there wasn't very much of a connection. There wasn't very much \nof a connection between, between all of that love and whatever that I put in, and \nthen all of a sudden you know, I became just another uh, you know, I became just \nanother black person. I became just another nigger. You know, and I think it's \nimportant to understand that my wife is you know, is white, German Irish. (T: \nMhm, hmm. I see.) And I think that's a part of that whole thing. (T: Mhm, hmm. \nMhm, hmm) Um, when we first married, you know, my father-in-law, we just \nfought tooth and nail, but then after that we loved each other . . . for about six long,  \ngood, hard years. And basically, he was my only connection and when he died . . . I  \nfound that there was no support. (T: Mhm, hmm) There was absolutely no support.\nT 12: And I, I imagine . . . or perhaps I catch a little bit of resentment, that you really \npoured a lot of love and caring into that family and had gotten some back from \nhim, but after his death, none of it paid off for you in any way.\nC 13: Right. For sure. Yeah, I think that, you know, what I wanted, what I wanted more \nthan anything else, was just to you know, I guess, was love. I guess it was that \nmutualness, you know, what I felt for each of them. (T: Mhm, hmm) You know, I \nthought that was not only my responsibility, but you know, it was very natural for \nme to care about people (T: Mhm, hmm) that were very close to my wife (T: Mhm,  \nhmm) at that time.\nT 13: So it hurt not to get that love back. It wasn't mutual.\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 1st Interview, page 71C 14: Oh yeah. For sure it did.\n[Rogers Commentary 4:  I always try to sense the feelings just below his words and he \nwelcomes that. I try to catch the resentment and the hurt which he hasn't yet voiced very \nclearly.]\nC 15: And there were various things that happened in terms of things that were happening  \nback east . . . that people were wondering why I had left, you know, a good \nposition and all that kind of garbage. And uh, because, see, I hadn't told anybody \nthat I had leukemia. (T: Mhm, hmm) And uh, one thing led to another. And there \nwere stories that needed, I think to um, I think every story, every situation needs to \nhave two sides. (T: Mhm, hmm) And there was only one side and I was, I was hurt \nbecause I didn't have my chance. \nT 15: You never were heard.\nC 16: Never. And, but at the same time, like, in a way, in a way, I used to feel that I put \nmyself in that position. Because no one knew what was happening inside of me, \nyou see. Because I had to take care of myself. And I had to be better than \neverybody else. Because I was always told that. You can, in a majority society I \nhad to be 100, 200 percent better than my white counterpart (T: Mhm, hmm) or my  \nbrown counterpart, (T: Mhm, hmm) or whatever. I had to do that, because that's \nwhat it took to survive .\nT 16: Mhm, hmm. And in striving for that, one reason you really weren't heard was that \nyou didn't dare express the person you were, the sick person you were at that time.\nC 17: Oh, no. Not at - I really, I really had a fear of that. You know? (T: Mhm, hmm) I \nreally, I guess, didn't trust some things that were happening, (T: Mhm, hmm) um, \ngee, at a whole global level, you know. But to, then to entrust that kind of \ninformation (T: Mhm, hmm) to other people. (T: Mhm, hmm) I was very uneasy \nabout that. (T: Frightening) Very uneasy about that. (T: Mhm, hmm) And I did a \nlot of things that I didn't, didn't really want to do (T: Mhm, hmm) because I was \nvery desperate. Um, I gave up my, my job and came out here, and I did consultant \nwork and so forth, but I had to use a great deal of money for diagnosticians or (T: \nMhm, hmm) whatever and, and, and all kinds of little gimmicks to keep me alive. \n(T: Mhm, hmm) And consequently I had to borrow money. And when I borrowed \nthat money, I didn't borrow it in a way that would say to you like, \"Hey, uh, Ted or \nwhatever, I need, you know X amount of dollars, you know, and like . . . 'cause I've  \ngot, I have leukemia,\" and so forth. I'm scared to death to say that, you know? (T: \nMhm, hmm) You know, I needed some money because of uh, I think I must have \ninvented about ten stories, you know. And I think about it and you know, like, I felt  \nreal bad about that, you know. (T: Mhm, hmm) And uh, because like I had \ndeveloped a professional uh, attitude I think, about myself, or at least a kind of . . . \nI had a lot of respect from a lot of people. (T: Mhm, hmm) And you know, I really \ndid have that . . . I don’t know if that was love or caring or whatever, but it was \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 1st Interview, page 72respect. (T: Yeah) When I got involved with money, the situation with money, I \nhad to borrow money and I really couldn't tell. And in a way, you know, I really \nwanted to tell, but I hadn't even told my wife (T: Yeah) and my family. (T: Yeah) \nAnd I said, okay, well one thing, you know, and I'm gonna, I'm going to be okay, \nand this money is going to be here, and everything else like that and I think that's a \npart of, uh, me that I really, I'm not really sure, that ah, you know, is really \nacceptable you know, because I have to be perfect.\nT 17: Yeah. Yeah. So, it's not acceptable even to you to do some of the things you did, \nand also I gather to live behind that facade of falsehood for quite awhile . . . not \ntelling anybody what the score was.\nC 18: Oh yeah. For sure. Very true. I . . .\n[Rogers Commentary 5:  The hurt and fear of revealing himself as ill is almost worse than  \nthe illness]\nC 19: That was very difficult. The most difficult part, I think, of (T: Mhm, hmm) I think \nit was the most difficult part of my illness. It was that, \"Hey, I couldn't have \ncancer,\" you know. That's like having V.D. and three kinds of V.D. at the same \ntime. (T: Mhm, hmm) You know, how do you tell someone, \"I have leukemia . . . I \nhave less than a year to live, or whatever (T: Mhm, hmm) . . . and I need some \nmoney.\" (T: Mhm, hmm) You know, it's like when people you know, look at a \ndrinking glass or whatever, and you know, after you told them you have cancer . . . \nand they make kind of a . . . shy away from your drinking glasses.\nT 19: Mhm, hmm. Mhm, hmm. How could you possibly let anybody know where you \nwere physically?\n[Rogers Commentary 6:  One of the hardest things for a dying person is the reaction that \nothers have to him. So, when he's talking of death and dying, I feel it's highly important \nto be right with him; to recognize and accept his feelings. ]\nC 20: I really don't know. I really, you know, I've really tried to debate this thing in \nmyself for a long time, and I really, I really don't know how I could have done \nanything any other way, because, you see, it was my character (T: Mhm, hmm) to \nnot, I never . . . I'm always there to help other people. (T: Mhm, hmm) I wasn't \nthere for . . . to say, \"Hey, you know, I need some nourishment right now, \nwhatever, you know.\"\nT 20: You've just had no experience in being the needy person that needed help and \nneeded . . .\nC 21: Absolutely. Even when I needed money or whatever, I didn't need money (T: \nYeah) because of my health. (T: Mhm, hmm) It was because of maybe bad \nbusiness experience or an investment, or something or other . . . and like, for the \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 1st Interview, page 73people who trusted that kind of information or whatever . . . like I, you know, well, \nI'm going to deal with that. I'm going to deal with that. But that's not in my \ncharacter, it's never been in my character. (T: Mhm, hmm) I had to keep that \nimage. (T: Mhm, hmm) I had to keep the image. (T: Mhm, hmm) And uh, it cost \nme my family, a couple children, you know. I guess that was the most important \nthing that it cost me. I think the other things are really not that important. But, but \nwhat it did do, what the leukemia did do . . . it helped me to, to understand that I'm \njust an ordinary human being like everybody else. (T: Mhm, hmm. Mhm, hmm) \nYou know, and sometimes you know, like, everybody has problems, and so forth, \nbut at the same time it was like, it was my character to do that. You know, I \nwouldn't tell them. No. For what?\nT 21: But it sounds as though the leukemia helped you to really destroy the notion of you \nas the \"image.\"\nC 22: I think, I think it did. I think it did. Finally, at the end it did. I use the end . . . the \nfour weeks when I was told I had four weeks to live (T: Mhm, hmm. Mhm, hmm) \nthat was the end, at the end of the leukemia. Even though I'm in remission now, (T:  \nMhm, hmm) I don't plan to, I don't . . . you see, I haven't told you that I went to, I \nwent for the tests and gave enormous amounts of blood. I don't know where they \nwere sending that blood or what they were doing with it. I gave an extraordinary \namount, but nothing, nothing was coming of that. But you know, one of the things I  \ndid know that if I went to the hospital, if I did what the doctors said, I'd probably \ndie. And it's almost like, you know, when you first become an agnostic in school, \nor whatever, you know, you go through . . . like I went through all this religious \ntraining, whatever. . . and I said, \"I don't think that there's a God.\" Or, \"that isn't \nreally important, or whatever.\" (T: Mhm, hmm) But then at the same time, I hold \nback, you know. And every now and then I give an occasional prayer (T: Right) \njust in case.\nT 22: Play it safe.\nC 23: For sure. I think that's what I was also doing in terms of the leukemia. I really did. I  \nhad . . . the logical end to leukemia that my uncle and cousin had had before me \nwas to die. (T: Mhm, hmm) Was to die. And now I think I know some things about  \nthat, though, that you don't have to die. Because it wasn't until I saw everybody \nthrowing leaves and things on my grave that I really understood that I had the \npower to do that, and that, by lying for money, was probably worse for me than . . .  \nthan the leukemia, I think. (T: Hmm) I don’t know if that makes any sense . . .\nT 23: Yeah. It does.\nC 24: Now I said it. (laughs)\nT 24: Mhm, hmm. Mhm, hmm. Somehow, what I get out of it is that being kind of false \nto yourself really was more of a burden to you, causes you more concern, than the \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 1st Interview, page 74fact that you had leukemia.\nC 25: Oh, for sure. For sure.\n[Rogers Commentary 7: I think this is the first time he voices a feeling that he has not \nrealized before. That's a significant point in any first interview. ]\nC 26: The other thing was that I was about ready to leave my children, you know, very \nyoung, beautiful children . . . children that I'd brought into the world to do the same  \nkind of, kind of thing that I was doing, you know . . . to take the world on their \nback (T: Mhm, hmm) and change things. (T: Mhm, hmm) You know, and now that  \nhelped me now with my kids in the sense of I don't think I want to raise my \nchildren like that.\nT 26: Mhm, hmm. You don't want them to carry the kind of burden and image that you \ncarried.\nC 27: No. Not at all. (T: Mhm, hmm) Not because they're part Indian. Not because they're  \npart black. Or not because they're third world or whatever. They don't have to carry  \nthat burden of trying to change and always being the recipient of certain policies \nand things like that and always being controlled. (T: Mhm, hmm. Mhm, hmm) And  \nI never really, it made me feel apart . . . because I don't know if my second grade \nteacher thought they were doing me a favor by telling me I was a credit to my race,  \n(T: Mhm, hmm. Mhm, hmm) but then . . . they certainly did, and I didn't feel good \nabout it then. (T:  Mhm, hmm) (Sigh) That's a start. (T: Mhm, hmm)\n[Rogers Commentary 8:  He has come to the end of his rehearsed part and now he is in \nnew territory. I'm comfortable with the silence and I'm eager to see where he goes next. \nIt's his choice.]\nC 28: And I remember talking to a person when I came down. I'd just discovered I was in  \nremission, and I was hobbling on a cane, and so forth, and God, the first thing I did  \ndown here was to take a motorcycle ride. Now, for me, that was radical. (T: Mhm, \nhmm) For me, that was extremely radical, but it was fun (T: Mhm, hmm) you \nknow, and it was one of the first fun things that I did. (T: Mhm, hmm) Since I was \nill, you know, because on top of having the leukemia I was fighting a divorce and \nhaving my property ripped away from me, you know, and having married into a \nfamily, and a family that was a different race than I was, and I learned later, as my \nwife told me that she didn't know that a whole community wanted to divorce. (T: \nLaughs) Like they were married. And I was hurt by that too. (T: Mhm, hmm. \nMhm, hmm) You know, how very good, (T: Mhm, hmm) Christian, (T: Mhm, \nhmm) upstanding people (T: Mhm, hmm) can make some pretty serious judgments \nwithout knowing you know, the whole story.\nT 28: And I catch a note of bitterness there. A feeling that they really make judgments \nwithout, without knowing the picture.\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 1st Interview, page 75C 29: For sure. For sure. Well, the thing that was incredible was that I didn't . . . forgot \nabout, I guess is that to understand, that you know, . . . I forgot for maybe a couple \nof years - Now, I'm going to oversimplify this next thing (T: Mhm, hmm) . . . but I \nforgot that I was black, (T: Mhm, hmm. Mhm, hmm) in that family, in that \ncommunity, (T: Mhm, hmm) or whatever, you see. (T: Mhm, hmm) And then I \nquickly learned that I . . .\nT 29: And then you were reminded all over again.\nC 30: Oh, for sure. For sure. And I think that also caused a lot of bitterness or whatever. \n(R Mhm, hmm) And that kind of stuff I want to get out of me. (T: Mhm, hmm. \nMhm, hmm) You know, I can't deal with that . . . someone else's trip on me. \nBecause I really don't hate anybody for that or whatever. A lot of the things I've \nbrought on myself. But at the same time, I think I really do have the right at that \ntime to have been desperate.\nT 30: Yeah.\nC 31: And I didn't really understand that.\n[Rogers Commentary 9:  This is a real step in self-acceptance: the acceptance of himself \nas a desperate person. ]\nC 32: It was just, you know, hey it was so bad, it got so bad . . . this whole trip of \nleukemia . . . and lying and things like that or whatever, that I don't know. I \nthought, \"Well, if I can just get ahead a little bit, and make enough money to pay \noff all those people or whatever, or, and even in my will and with my insurance\" \n(T: Mhm, hmm. Mhm, hmm) You know, I made sure that all of the people were \ngoing to be paid or whatever (T: Mhm, hmm) but, you know. I still wasn't, it still \nwasn't acceptable to me for some reason . . . I didn't want to go out owing anybody \nor (T: Mhm, hmm) whatever, because that wasn't, wouldn't be the American thing \nto do, I guess at that time.\nT 32: That wouldn't be living up to the standards you've set for yourself and other people \nhave set for you.\nC 33: Oh. Yeah. For sure. And like, I'm a little tired of those standards. (T: Mhm, hmm) \nI'm really a little tired (T: Mhm, hmm) of those standards. And I basically think \nthat the kind of things that um, . . . me and what I'm into, and what turns me on . . . \nis good for me. (T: Mhm, hmm) And I don't really know why I went into \nremission. You know, I have some feelings about that . . . you know, personal, \nreligious, whatever. But I think a great part of that had something to do with \ndeciding that I wanted to live.\nT 33: Mhm, hmm. Perhaps, sounds as though you're saying several things here, that \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 1st Interview, page 76perhaps deciding you wanted to live made a real difference. And also deciding that \nwhat you were experiencing as your needs and your wants and so on, really had \nsome validity.\nC 34: Yeah. It's really good to hear you say that. Because I really feel that. Because what \nI did I think was . . .\n[Rogers Commentary 10:  It is so good to feel understood. It's releasing. It shows the \nvalue of really getting inside the client's world and understanding it and communicating \nthat understanding to the client. ]\n-\n[Rogers Commentary 11:  Little by little he is experiencing his bitterness, and his real \ndesperation.]\nC 37: My phone bill had to be about $1,500 a month you know, because I was so worried  \nabout (T: Mhm, hmm) the children, you know.\nT 37: Mhm, hmm. So that was a big, heavy burden too, then huh?\nC 38: Oh, yeah. Yeah, it really was pretty heavy. It was pretty heavy.\n[Rogers Commentary 12:  This is the first comfortable pause. I feel he is kind of catching \nup with himself and with the feelings he has voiced. ]\nEnd of Part 1 (End of first reel of the film) \nT 38: Life has been a very fluctuating up and down, kind of\nC 39: For sure. But the leukemia took me away from Michigan, which I have . . . oh, \nbless somebody for that. And if you know, I only live a couple of more months, or \nwhatever, it's a lot better (T: Mhm, hmm) than living under uh, constant stress (T: \nMhm, hmm) you know of worrying about not being accepted, or not being \naccepted.\nT 39: But that's one good thing that the leukemia did for you.\nC 40: Yeah. It really was. Because I got a divorce out of it. My goodness, I got to \nCalifornia. Um, and I really mean that.\n[Rogers Commentary 13:  Previously, the divorce was a hurt. Here it sounds more like a \nblessing. I wish to follow and be with each feeling as it arises no matter how ephemeral it  \nmay be.]\nC 41: But even when I say it, you know, there's . . . it was a rough, scratchy, scratchy \nroad . . . and you know, it's extremely difficult for me to talk about it now. (T: \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 1st Interview, page 77Mhm, hmm) It really is .\n[Rogers Commentary 14:  Notice how his speech has slowed down. It shows he's working \non himself. A client's whole speech pattern changes when he's exploring difficult new \nterrain.]\nC 42: In getting all those bad things out, I'm not sure in terms of how to deal (T: Mhm, \nhmm) yet, or whatever. And I'm really not sure. But there are some you know, \nsome things you know, like, I've really got to come to grips with it. \"Well, finally,\" \nyou know. Because they're still, you know, when I talk to my wife from 3,000 \nmiles away and she tells me about what her mother thinks and all sorts of other \nthings, or whatever, I get sick. It happened yeah . . . it happened the other day. She \ncalled and everything was really great and then she'd begin to talk about a lot of \nother people, and what their attitudes and what their opinions was. That night I got \nvery little sleep and was ready to go back to the hospital and was ready to have \nleukemia too. (T: Mhm, hmm) I was ready. You know?\nT 42: So you feel as though in some sense you prepare the readiness for the illness, or \nyou, are taking in something from outside; it makes you ready to have it.\nC 43: It seems like it. You know, I didn't believe that. I didn't believe that statement that \nyou just made, some time ago, (T: Mhm, hmm) but I believe it now. (T: Mhm, \nhmm) I believe it.\n[Rogers Commentary 15:  A fascinating awareness of the psychological source of his \nsymptoms.]\nC 44: You know, I recall when I went back, and, and, and um, for the first time, my \nparents had learned that I had leukemia. You know, what do you say to your \nmother? What do you say to your father? I remember I got a phone call. And I was \nstaying at my wife's house where we were going, keep in mind now, we were going  \nthrough a divorce, the whole bit, and were, uh celebrating my children's birthday at  \nthe same time. My mother calls. \"We're coming over.\" Nobody at the house. All of \na sudden I lose my . . . my vision goes. (T: Mhm, hmm) You know, that was one of  \nthe symptoms (T: Mhm, hmm) of leukemia. And uh, and, it scare-, it scared the \nhell out of me (T: Mhm, hmm) like I really wanted to run. But I couldn't run, I \ncouldn't see. (T: Couldn't see.) And um, it was only when I got back to California \nthat I tried to put that together, you know (T: Mhm, hmm) of what happened when \n(T: Mhm, hmm) in terms of you know, the paralysis that I had in terms of my legs. \nIt's incredible, it really seemed like somehow, somehow I've got control of that, in \nsome way but I mean I'm not really sure. But I'm convinced that I have control. (T: \nMhm, hmm) But I'm not sure how. (T: Mhm, hmm) You know. (T: Mhm, hmm)\nT 44: I gather you feel that where before these things happened to you because of what \nhappened to you from the outside, now you are beginning to feel control over it \nyourself . . . from the inside. Is that, is that part of what you're saying?\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 1st Interview, page 78C 45: I think that's what I'm saying.\n[Rogers Commentary 16: This raises the whole question of what is illness? In what sense  \nis it psychological and what sense is it physical? I can only go with the psychological \nreality as he presents it to me. ]\nC 46: When I'm positive and when I’m doing things that I enjoy, I don't have symptoms \n(T: Mhm, hmm) anymore. (T: Mhm, hmm) I don't have symptoms. And I don't you  \nknow, like, when I came down here, the doctors wanted me to have transfusions \nand things like that, you know, and I remember one doctor saying to me, \"I don't \nknow really who's got you into playing this tennis and all that, or whatever, but you  \nreally need to come in here and have a transfusion.\" I said, \"For what? I'm doing \nokay.\" \"To be on the safe side.\" You know? (T: Mhm, hmm) That's . . . well, I \nwon't say what that is. (Rogers laughs) But, you know, like, to some extent though,  \nthat confirms some things to me about not trusting doctors to take care of myself. \n(T: Mhm, hmm) I'm talking about the leukemia. (T: Yeah) I'm certainly not trying \nto indict all doctors or the medical profession (T: Sure) by what happened to me, \n(T: Mhm, hmm) you know, I think, I hope, in some way that other people who \nhave life-threatening illnesses can deal with it because I think I have, and I do have  \nthat control. And like, since I was 7, to some extent, when I went down in that \nbasement and turned that light off, or whatever, and I shut the outside world off . . .  \nor whatever, somehow I've lost that . . . because somehow in the process of \nbecoming educated and socialized, and whatever, (T: Mhm, hmm. Mhm, hmm) I \nlet other people control what I wanted and what I wanted to do. And I really . . . I \ndid. That was a . . . Jesus, that was a, yeah, well, okay.\nT 46: That has a lot of meaning to me, and I want to make sure I'm getting it straight. \nDown in that basement as a 7-year old with the lights out . . . you were really \nfinding yourself and, I gather, trusting yourself. (C: Mhm, hmm) And then life was,  \nsaid to you, \"No, no, don't do that. We have the standards for you. Live up to our \nexpectations. You've got to be the image. You've got to be just right. And \neverything.\" And now you are gradually recapturing what you felt as a 7-year old.\nC 47: I believe that to be true. Because even though that you know, the responsibility, \nyou know, it was like something inside of me could touch something that wasn't \nseen . . . when I was seven. (T: Mhm, hmm. Mhm, hmm) And I can't remember \nwhat the book was that Young wrote, or whatever. (T: Mhm, hmm) But it had an \nextraordinary effect on me, this seven- year-old, you know? (T: Mhm, hmm) You \nknow, I started writing poetry. My first poem. But I guess I did lose it. I did lose it. \nLike I still had it, but all this garbage about me being . . .\nT 47: It was well buried?\nC 48: Yeah. Yeah. And then other people were shaping me up by saying, well, you know,  \n\"You're really good if you do it this way, or whatever.\"\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 1st Interview, page 79T 48: \"You're a credit to your race.\"\nC 49: Oh, yeah. \"You're extraordinary. You're a credit to your race.\" You know, and, I \ndon't know. Maybe they meant very well, or whatever, but it didn't do the job. It \ndidn't do the job, you know, because in a way, by accepting that kind of praise, and  \ntheir kind of . . . buying into their kind of system, or whatever, like, I gave up \nsomething that I knew already at 7 years old.\nT 49: And that something, as I get it, is you were giving up something of yourself.\nC 50: Yeah. I've . . . sounds good. Yeah, I did. I did.\n[Rogers Commentary 17:  This really touches him. He’s letting it sink in. He's \nexperiencing his loss of self. This is the very heart of therapy. When I can provide a \nclimate in which the client can experience his buried feelings rather than describe them \nor be told about them, it has a much more powerful and enduring effect. ]\nC 51: You know, maybe I'd have been better off if I'd just gone on and lived my life \nrather than try to live other people's lives or whatever, you know. But I gave up \nbeing happy myself. You know, I didn't expect you know, I guess I didn't expect \nmyself to be happy, or to really maybe deserve happiness, or something.\nT 51: Sounds like you wanted so much to help people, that ah helping yourself didn't fit \ninto that picture at all.\nC 52: Not at all. Not at all. There was enough to do without worrying about your own (T: \nMhm, hmm) little problems and things like that (T: Mhm, hmm) at that time, so I \nsaid to myself then, you know? Oh, yeah. A lot of things are racing through my \nmind as we talk and, but there are certain things that go through this whole thing \nthat I pick out in terms of when I was seven, and those are just really important \ntimes for me, you know. They were important times in terms of when I was alone, \nand when I was sure, and when I felt good and I felt a part of the you know, the \nstars, the universe. I really did feel that. You know, I remember I used to go out \nwhen I was 7, 8, 9 years old . . . three or four o'clock in the morning, look up in \nthat beautiful sky and see those stars (T: Mhm, hmm) or whatever, (T: Mhm, hmm)  \nand I'd say, \"That's mine over there and I'm going to be there.\" And I felt good. I \nfelt I don't know, in a sense integrated, more integrated than after . . . and as I \ncontinued (T: Mhm, hmm) to do this and fill out the forms for a scholarship, or \nthings like that, I lost it. I really lost it.\nT 52: At seven, you were really a part of the universe and you knew it.\nC 53: That's what I thought. But you know, what does a 7 year old know, you know, I \ndon't know.\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 1st Interview, page 80[Rogers Commentary 18:  This has been a marvelous picture of the wholeness of the child  \nand it's description by society. I'm trying as in all my therapy to help him get back to the \nkind of realness he had as a child. ]\nC 54: I think I did. Yes, I knew it. I knew it because I knew, because I was always drawn \nto the stars, you know. (T: Mhm, hmm) It wasn't anything like my parents would \nwake me up in the middle of the night, or whatever, I woke up; I don't know why.\nT 54: It was something that you wanted to do. It was something you had a view. Not \nbecause somebody else said, \"Hey you should be interested in the stars or \nsomething like that.\"\nC 55: For sure. For sure. And I was, I think at that time I was really the best person that I \ncould be. And you know, I guess, for some reason, I don't want to heap it on \neverybody else you know, but I was just taught, conditioned or something that . . . \nto not trust that anymore. (T: Mhm, hmm) To . . . you know. (T: Uh, huh) It's like \nthose things when you're young you hold onto or whatever.\nT 55: \"But then, that's just childish. That's just . . . \"\nC 56: Right. Right. Yeah.\nT 56: \"Don't trust that stuff.\" (C: Mhm, hmm) \"They're telling you what's right.\" (C: \nYeah.)\nC 57: Yeah, yeah. I've really suppressed . . . I guess a hell of a lot of anger. 'Cause you \nknow, when you said that, you know, I felt you know, like . . . you know, I think of  \nall kind of words now.\n[Rogers Commentary 19: Speaking in society's voice when I said, \"Oh that's just \nchildishness, they're telling you what is right.\" There's something intuitive on my part but  \nit released his anger. I like to follow my intuition and I've learned to trust it. ]\nC 58: Really for sure. You’re a minority . . . and in terms of a minority within a minority \nwithin a minority. Like mother's Osage. She's part Indian, (T: Mhm, hmm) her \nfamily . . . that history. (T: Mhm, hmm) Father a descendant of black slaves. (T: \nMhm, hmm) You know? And then being picked out, you know? (T: Mhm, hmm) \nBecause that's what it was, you know, 'cause I knew what was happening to other \npeople in the class, whether they were white or black or whatever. But it was . . . \nyou know, but I always really understood that I had to be 200 percent better than \neverybody else so I'd achieve. I almost killed myself playing football because I \nwanted to be the littlest superstar, whatever that means. (T: Mhm, hmm. Mhm, \nhmm) It's crazy things. You know, it was that competitiveness, or whatever, you \nknow. And it was that I wouldn't have anything if I didn't compete and if I didn't do  \nit like, you know, somebody else told me to do. (T: Mhm, hmm) I guess.\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 1st Interview, page 81T 58: So those standards and what they did to you really, really dominated your life, if I \nget it right.\nC 59: I think so. I really think so. I, I uh, my reference point became . . . and I guess I \nbought into that. You know, I really bought into that. And I really, it really seems \nforeign to me now. It seems as foreign, I think, as leukemia, you know. (T: Mhm, \nhmm) You know I've . . . it really does, you know.\nT 59: Yeah. One way of putting it is I feel you are saying, \"Damn it, that seven year old \nwas more right than all that's gone on in between.\"\nC 60: Yeah. Yeah. And maybe trying to get back to that, and whatever, and now and uh, \nyou know, I just wonder how, how that person at 7 would have been dealing with \nthe leukemia and all those other problems now. (T: Mhm, hmm) It would have been  \ninteresting, I think. Probably would've handled it much better. (T: Mhm, hmm. \nMhm, hmm) (Pause 7 seconds) (Laughs) Feel some kind of release. I don't know.\n[Rogers Commentary 20: Notice how his voice has slowed, become more thoughtful and \ncalm. He's getting closer to himself by revealing some of himself. And it feels good. ]\nC 61: I told a lot of people you know, about um, about me. You know, and something that  \ncame out you know, and that other part of me may be . . . I'm really wondering \nabout trusting too, right now. (T: Mhm, hmm) You know (T: Mhm, hmm) 'cause \nI've trusted a lot of other people, too. (T: Mhm, hmm)\nT 61: And so you're wondering, \"Yeah, but can I trust him?\"\nC 62: Hmm. Well . . .\nT 62: Maybe part of that reason is you feel, \"My God, I've told him a lot. I've trusted him. \nHave I trusted him too much?\"\nC 63: Sure. Well, I guess I'm just going to have to deal with it in terms of do I trust myself  \nto tell you. (T: Mhm, hmm) You know, but I do have that, you know. I have that \nhistory. (Laughs)\n[Rogers Commentary 21:  Is it safe to trust me with this more vulnerable part of himself? \nClients often have such doubts and I respond in a way which helps him to realize that I \nrecognize and accept that question. ]\nC 64: You know, . . . but I've really been you know, like a lot of other people, like a lot of \nother people, you know, or whatever. But I've learned so many things from this, \nthis whole thing, or whatever, you know. And even just sitting here and talking \nwith you, whether you're Carl Rogers or Jesus Christ or whatever, you know . . .\nT 64: Or Joe Doakes.\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 1st Interview, page 82C 65: Or whomever, you know, it's a, still it's a very difficult thing for me to . . .\nT 65: Yeah. Yeah.\nC 66: And I don't know if I just haven't allowed myself to be open, you know, and to be \nneedy or whatever. But is that junk? That \"credit to . . .\" You know, that really \nmakes me mad. That really made me mad. I mean, I keep, in mind as I'm talking, it \nkeeps coming back to me, you know. \"Credit to my race, to my race.\" I remember \nthat teacher so well, with big boobs, and she put my head right in them and said I \nwas a credit to her race. And you know, that . . . oh, that burned me up.\nT 66: So as you get deeper into that feeling it isn't just that you, earlier, you said you \nwondered if it was wise of her to do that. Now you know, \"Damn it, I'm really \nangry at her for doing that to me.\"\nC 67: Yeah. And I'm even more angrier when I see it happening all the time. And I don't \nwant it to happen to my kids. (T: Mhm, hmm) And I didn't really want my kids to \nbe a credit to their race. You know? (T: Mhm, hmm) And I know that now. Getting  \nmilitant. (Laughter)(Pause 6 seconds)(Sigh)\n[Rogers Commentary 22:  He finds it very hard to experience his anger. He only talks \nabout it rather coolly. The sigh though, is one of real letting down. A relaxing, a trusting.  \nWe really are in relationship. ]\nT 67: Our time's about up and I don't know if there’s more you want to say now for \ntoday, okay. Or if not, we can call it quits for today.\nC 68: Well I'd like to be able to tell you something.\nT 68: All right.\nC 69: That is going to make me feel good. That is going to continue to have me feel \npositive about myself and to grow and to be nourished or whatever, but I'm really \nnot sure what to say. You know, but I really want to do that, so that I can continue \nto live, you know. (T: Mhm, hmm. Mhm, hmm) That's important to me, and so (T: \nMhm, hmm) um, but it's just not coming. But I think I really want to say that and \nbe comfortable in saying, you know, \"I got raked over the coals and I resent it and \nI'm mad and I'm angry and I need to get that to be angry (T: Okay) You know. (T: \nMhm, hmm)\nT 69: \"Okay. I was really screwed by a lot of people, and I have reason to be angry, and I \nam angry, and I need to say that.\" I can hear the anger in there.\nC 70: Yeah. But you know how I haven't said it yet, though, you know. I really haven't. \nYou know, I think it um, I think it's just a part of being civilized maybe.\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 1st Interview, page 83T 70: Mhm, hmm. You're talking about it in a very civilized fashion. (C: Right) Living up  \nto those standards.\nC 71: Yeah. Which I'd like to just go back and kick some butts, I think. (Sigh) Well, \nenough of the militancy.\nT 71: Okay? Shall we call it quits for today?\nC 72: Yeah. I think so.\nT 72: Alright good. See you tomorrow.\n[Rogers Commentary 23:  He has revealed more of himself than he expected to. He's \ngoing from a presentation of himself to exploring himself. From talking politely to talking  \nhonestly about anger. I believe this has happened because I've followed every feeling I \ncould even when he seems to be scattered, to be talking about several different things, \nI've tried to stay with and respond to the most central of his feelings. I feel like we've \nmade a start. On a more intellectual level, this session provides dramatic evidence of the \ntheory that the child is open to all experiencing. That he or she feels the locus of \nevaluation is in the self. Then the family, the educational system and the culture pound \nhome the lesson, \"Don't believe in your own experience but learn to live by others' \nexpectations. Then you'll be rewarded by love.\" Therapy means slowly discarding those \nintrojections and gradually recapturing the person as he was in his childhood. ]\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 1st Interview, page 84This transcript is available for purposes of research, study and teaching.

M. (Producer). (1977). Carl Rogers counsels an individual on anger \nand hurt [Film]. American Personnel and Guidance Association.]\n[Rogers: This is the second interview with a young man who reports he has leukemia, but  \nis in a state of remission.  In his first interview he realized that the self he had at age 7, was  \na very precious self and that social expectations caused him to lose it.  He had also  \napproached the feelings of anger he has felt about what has been done to this self and to  \nhim.  But he has not yet expressed his anger.  Now the second sessions begins.]\nT1:O.K. Where do you want to start this morning? \nC2:Uh, I don't know.  I wa ... I was thinking that when we ... when we talked earlier  \nabout the, the anger ... (T: Mmm.)  I've been thinking a great deal about that.\nT2:I've thought a lot about what you had to say about that.\nC3:Right, you know, and I'm not sure that, uh, that I really don't want to be angry, you  \nknow, and I'm not sure if anger ... being angry now, is a part of the process and I've  \ngot to do that, but I'd like to ... I guess my uh ... I guess my mind uh academical ly or \nsomething, you know, and something other than emotion or whate ver, like, would \nlike to tell me that, uh, I'd like to uh ... to not be angry and to skip over that part, if  \nthat's a part of the process, you know?  But I'm not sure I can do that (small laugh),  \nyou know.\nT3:Your mind says sort of, \"Oh, cool it.  Don't ... don't get into uh, such strong emo -\ntion\".\nC4:For sure.  It almost  seems  like  that  ... that  uh whatever  is  happening  in my  \nenvironment or whatever happened in my environ ment is pulling me into again uh,  \nthat kind of a trap ... that kind of a system that I don't particularly care ... er, er, you  \nknow, if you know what I mean.\nT4:Mmm. I think I get that:  that your ... your mind is taking the place of the system in  \nsaying now, uh, \"Play it right.  Do the right ... do the proper thing\".  \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 85C5:Right.\nT5:But some other part of you is saying, \"Yeah, but there's some anger the re\". \nC6:For sure. For sure.\nT6:There's some real anger there. \nC7:Right.  It's ... it's almost like in this country ... and, and I've always  felt like this ...  \nyou only have about two options, you know, when you deal with ra ce ... you either \nhave to be ... you're either a racist or you're an anti -racist. (T: Mmm.)  And that  \ndoesn't really seem to be the kind of thing that I'm, you know ....  I don't really care  \nto be an anti-racist, if you know what I mean (T: Mmm.) anymore. Uh, and I don't  \nwanna be a reflection of any other ... of any other larger society at all. (T: Mmm.) I  \nreally don't want to ...\nT7:You'd like to get in touch with what's going on in you. \nC8:For sure.\nT8:Not ... not some label or other. \nC9:For sure.  I think that I could probably trust that a lot better than, than, than trusting  \nwhat's happening or what has happened. (T: Mmm.)  And, um, and when I think  \nabout that ... when I think about all of that, you know, uh, the things that we talked  \nabout ... I, I, I think that, um, that's worse than the leuke mia.\nT9:      Uh, uh-huh.\nC10:You know? I know that may sound very strange or whatever, but a lot of things have  \nbeen strange \nT10:Mmm. Mmm.\nC11:You know, since this time; and, and what has happe ned to me didn't just start when I  \nfound out that I, you know, was going to die. (T: Mmm.) Kind of thing.\nT11:Let me see if I understand that.  That you feel as though, um, what the culture and \npeople and so on have ... have done to you ... that's really caused you more suffering  \nthan the leukemia.   Is that what you're saying?  \nC12:I think so. (T: Mmm.)  I think so.  And to some extent that ... that would ...  that is  \nmild ... like, for instance, you know, you ... I don't know what would have happened  \nif I had died or if I will or whatever, but I certainly know what's hap pening now and \nwhat happened. \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 86T12: Mmm.\nC13: You see. \nT13:Mmm.\nC14:And to some extent that ... that kind of leukemia, that kind of deterio ration of the \nbody is the same kind of thing that happe ned to my mind.  (T: Mmm.)  And um ...  \n(T: Mmm.) You know, it’s ...\nT14:So really, what the culture did to you was give you a cancer of the mind.\nC15:Yeah. I, I, I, I really ... I think, I really want to say that and I really want to, um, and I  \nbelieve it, you know, and I guess that part of me that's, that's my culture or is a part  \nof the total, ... is saying that it's not all that good to be angry, you know, because  \nmilitancy is frowned upon or what ever, you know. (T: Mmm, mmm, mmm.)  And I  \nguess I'm using mili- militant in my sense because of ... it's, it's just traditionally, you  \nknow, when blacks become angry they're, they're not angry ... they're mili tant. (T: \nMmm.)  You know what I mean (slight laughter)?\nT15:I know.  Another label. \nC16:Mmm. For sure, for sure, for sure. Yeah.  And I ... and there's nobody that I can put  \nmy finger on, you know ... that person that started the whole thing ... that process,  \nyou know, because that would proba bly be a lot better for me, you know, then I  \nprobably would, would try to, to do ... to do that person in.\nT16:Yeah ... If you could ... (C: You know?) If you could pin it on one person, then your  \nrage would be justified and you could really get after that person.\nC17:Mmm.  But how, you know ... but how do you blame somebody else who's sick?  (T:  \nMmm.) You know?  And I think that people that do that to other people, or at least -\nwhen it was done to me, um ... they're really sick, you know.  And here I am, you  \nknow, trying to ... you know, I don't know if it was forgiving, I don't know if I'm  \nsounding  confused  or  whatever,  maybe,  you  know,  but  trying  to  accept  their  \nsickness, you know. \nT17:Mmm.\nC18:And at the same time, you know, I really haven't had the oppor tunity of letting \nanybody accept mine. \nT18:Mmm.\nC19:Or maybe I haven't given it to them, but ...\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 87T19:Yeah, maybe you haven't given it to them. \nC20:Right.\nT20:That's what I sense is going on now ...  that you feel \"there's so many reasons why I  \nreally shouldn't express my anger.  I'll, I'll talk about all those reasons\". \nC21:Yeah (small laugh), for sure.  I don't know really, you know.  Maybe I'll just be  \nangry one day (small laugh) and maybe I'll really feel better or whatever, you know,  \nand, and I ... when I, when I smile, I ... I'm uh, you know, I'm smiling but there’s a  \nlot of ... and I'm sure you know that ... there's a lot of anger there. (T: Mmm.) You  \nknow, but it's not my nature to be angry (T: Mmm.) It's not my nature to be angry,  \nbut I feel angry.\nT21:Yeah. Um, and uh so I hear you explaining and explaining that uh, uh,  \"that's not my  \nnature to be angry.  It's just that I am angry right now\". \nC22:For sure (slight laugh), for sure.  And to try to be angry in a productive ... I don't  \nknow how you'd be angry in a productive way ... you know, in terms of ...  It's like  \nnow when I ... when I respond to people, you know ... if, if when you en counter \npeople, you know, whether it's in the street, whether it's in a professio nal situation or \nwhatever, you know ...if people send out certain messages and wh ... no matter what  \nthey're saying or whate ver ... there are certain kinds of messages that I'm get ting, you \nknow.  They're saying that, \"hey, you know ... that isn't for me\" kind of thing, you  \nknow.  And that's befo re, you know, I'd like to work with that, and ride it ... like to  \ntry to communicate without aliena ting ... (T: Mmm.) people or whatever, but now,  \nyou know, I'm ending up saying, you know, like ...\"hey, that's a bunch of crap\", (T:  \nMmm.) you know. \"Don't ... don't, don't tell me about the way that I should do it or,  \nor give me all that nonverbal stuff about, um, you saying that I'm OK, but by non ver-\nbally saying ... \"hey\", you know, \"you're really not OK\", you know.  And I don't  \nwant to hear that kind of stuff anymore.\nT22:I get what you're saying and I also feel quite strongly that I want to say, \"it's OK with  \nme if you're angry here\"...\nC23:(Pause) ... But I don't, you know ... it's hard to know how to be angry, you know ...  \nhard to ...\nT23:Sure, sure, I'm not saying you have to be.  (C: Sure).  I'm just saying it's OK with me.  \nC24Mmm.\nT24:   If you feel like being angry, you can be angry.\nC25:You really believe that?\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 88T25:   Damn right. \n    \nC26:(12 second pause.) Well. (15 second pause.) (Sigh.) I'm not sure how to respond to  \nthat at all, you know, because a part of that anger is, you know, the ... the hurt, and  \nmaybe if I’m... maybe what's happening is that if I'm ... if I become angry and I  \nreally let it hang out, that I really will see how hurt I am. \nT26:Mmm, mmm.\nC27:And um, you know, that just came to me as you were tal king.\nT27:Mmm, mmm.\nC28:That, you know ...\nT28:Perhaps at a deeper level you're afraid of the hurt that you may experience if you let  \nyourself experience the anger.\nC29:For sure.\nT29:Mmm.\nC30:Really.\nT30:Mmm.\nC31:(Small laugh. Pause.) Um, whew ... (Pause.) I keep getting these blocks, you know ...  \nthese, you know ... when I come to somet hing like that, you know, because, you  \nknow, to me that's a revelation and I'm not really sure that, uh, risking being angry I  \nguess ... (T: Mmm.) or something like that, you know.\nT31:Mmm.\nC32:Losing control, maybe.\nT32:Yeah, mmm.\nC33:You know?  (Pause.)  Well ... (takes a drink of water).\nT33:I really do get that ...  that this ... this realization that, \"Maybe what I'm most afraid of  \nis the hurt that I might expe rience\", um, makes you more cautious about whether you  \nshould, whether you should or could really let go of the ... of the anger. \nC34:I really don't know, I think that ...\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 89T34:It's a risk. \nC35:Right.  And it's, you know ... I hadn't really thought about that before.\nT35: Mmm.  It's new. \nC36:Yeah.  It's, uh ... I guess I would be ... and I'd re-really would admit openly that I'm  \nhurt.  I, I said that I've been hurt.\nT36:Mmm.\nC37:And I think, you know, that I, I feel I've been hurt, but to really ... to show that, you  \nknow ...\nT37:To show it and ... I guess to let yourself sort of ... experien ce it, that ... that, I guess  \nwould be difficult. \nC38:Yeah, I, I don't know. It ... it's, it, it's as scary, I think, as the possibility of ... that I  \nhad before ... more than before, about dying, you know.\nT38:Mmm. Mmm.\nC39:And maybe, you know ... guess I was really scared because of the symp toms, you \nknow, of, of, you know ... not being able to walk and not being able to see, and  \nthings like that, you know.  And having to depend on somebody, you know.  And for  \nGod's sake, you know ... having to show somebody that I'm ... that I'm hurt.(T:  \nMmm.) And how, you know, how can I trust that to somebody, (T: Mmm) you  \nknow. Umm ...\nT39:Seems like a horribly big risk. \nC40:Yeah, it is (small laugh).  Seems to be getting bigger and bigger as we talk!\nT40:Mmm, mmm, mmm. \"Suppose I really expose to somebody the fact that I'm deeply,  \ndeeply hurt\".  That in a sense would be comparable to having to be dependent on  \nsomeone when you can't walk or something like that. \nC41:(Smiles and sighs.) Right. (Pause.)  Yeah.  I'd like to just to say it's my ... it’s trying  \nmy conditioning.  I try not to ... one way out of it ... and, uh (laughs) ...  But that ...  \nthat isn't really accepta ble to me now becau se I ... I, I, I, I  feel that I ... I feel like ...  \nthat I have to express that, that hurt or whate ver, but you know, I can say that, you  \nknow, and I know right down here, you know, I'm ... I'm saying that and when I say  \nit, you know, it kind of keeps some thing down here. (Gestures, hand to chest, palm  \ndown. Laughs.), you know.\nT41:Mmm.  You're saying it from here up.  (Gestures, hand at chest, palm down). \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 90C42:For sure. For sure (small laugh). I don't know how to do that exactly ... whatever ...  \nIt's like I don't drink a lot, you know, because I don't really want to, uh ... (T: Mmm.)  \n... experience that kind of, uh, you know ... alco hol to me is a depressant anyway,  \nand um, you know ... that's about the only thing I really like to get out ... to really get  \nout, you know, and maybe say ing, you know, like I'll love somebody.  \"I gave of  \nmyself\".  I did the ... hell ... the best I could, and it wasn't good enough, you know,  \nand you know, demand on top of demand and everything like that, you know ...  It's  \njust, you know ... Shit ... you know, it's, it's like that I'd like to be able uhh ... and I  \nsaid this here, the other day or when I was talking to you ... that I'd like to be able to,  \nto say that ... yeah, \"I was screwed over and I got hurt and everything else\", like that,  \nor whatever, but it's an ... it's almost an admission in a, in a way on another level of,  \nof ... of saying that they got the best of me, you know. \nT42:Mmm, mmm, mmm.\nC43:And I really don' want ...\nT43:Mmm.\nC44:You know, I really don't want anybody historically to get, have ... to have gotten the  \nbest of me ... but they did.  They did.  They beat the hell out of me.\nT44:You don't want to say, \"I really was defeated at times\", and yet that's the truth. \nC45:Mmm. It is. (Sighs.) (Pause.) You know, being ... having it being all right to be  \ndefeated and be beaten and I don't know if the re's any value in, you know ... maybe  \nto myself ... admitting it to myself, or whatever, you know, but you know, I ... I'm  \nreally finding out I got a lot of (laughs), hangups in terms of, in that line that I hadn't  \nthought of before, you know ... in terms of, you know, because I don't want to be  \nbeaten.  (T: Mmm.)  But I was, you know. \nT45:Mmm.\nC46:Because I think when you are hurt, that's being beaten except, you know ... \nT46:Mmm, mmm.\nC47:And I allowed myself to, and I don't regret caring, and I don't regret loving or  \nwhatever, but you know ... like I'm a ... I'm a kid, you know, I'm a kid in a way.  I  \nlike to be loved too; I like to be uh ... (T: Mmm, mmm.) ... some reciproci ty.  And \nI'm going to start, I think, expecting that.  You know ... without being cold or  \nanything like that.  (T: Mmm.)  But I have to, you know, start get ting something \nback in return.\nT47:You want love to be mutual. \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 91C48:For sure, for sure. (T: Mmm,hmm.) And I don't want to have, uh get in the situation  \nlike I'm in now, you know, where I'm afraid to, to, to, show anybody that I am, I'm  \nhurt, you know. (T: Mmm,mmm.)  Scared to death ... terri fied.\nT48:Something really awful about showing ... letting anyone know that \"I'm hurt\". (C:  \nYeah.)  \"I'm hurting\". \nC49:Sure, sure.  It's, you know ... it has something to do with being a man and it has  \nsomething to do with ... with the race thing, you know.\nT49:Mmm.\nC50:It has something to do with the relationship ... \nT50:Mmm.\nC51:Maybe the failure of a relationship, uh.  A ... a lot of things, you know ... a father not  \nbeing in the home with his children.\nT51:Mmm.\nC52:(Pause.)  You know, I really feel like being a victim.\nT52:Mmm.\nC53:(18 seconds pause. Smiles, takes a drink of water.) I don't know how to get that up at  \nall. (Small laugh.)  Every time I get close to that, I take a drink of water! (Laughs.)  \n(T: Laughs.) Uh, I don't know if that acts to keep it down there or what.\nT53:Maybe ... maybe, maybe that'll keep it from coming up above this level (gestures). \nC54:For sure.  I, I don't know.  See, how it, it really isn't what I want either. You know, I  \nwant it to get out and stay out, you know.\nT54:\"I would like to let it out\". \nC55:Yeah.  So maybe if you have any (sigh) exorcism type powers or what ever, (T: slight \nlaugh.) that, uh ... maybe you can just do that and then I'll be free of that, you know.  \nBecause that's what it feels like ... it feels like there's something there, you know, that  \nI really ... and I've identified it.  I think I've identi fied it, you know, because I know  \nthere're some times when there’s such a big lump in my throat, you know, and that I  \nexplain, I give myself a lot of reasons why I shouldn't be fee ling like that, you know.\nT55:A big lump of hurt, though. (C: Mmmm.) (15 second pause.) And how to let that hurt  \ncome out in the open ... how to let it ... emerge and be out here instead of way down  \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 92locked in here. \nC56:Right. (Small laugh.)  Yeah.  You know, I, I, I never believe in cook book answers to \nanything, even when I cook I don't use a cookbook.  I just don't believe in it. I think,  \nbut I'd really like to be able for somebo dy to tell me (T: Mmm) to, you know, maybe  \nhow to do that in about five minutes (T: Mmm) and be through with it so I can live  \nthe rest of my life in peace. (T: laughs.)  You know what I mean?\nT56:(Laughs.)  Sure.  It'd be awfully nice if somebody could say, \"Now, if you do this  \nand this, all your hurt will come out and it will be gone for ever\". \nC57: For sure.\nT57: Be great, wouldn't it? \nC58:For sure. (Laughs.)  I have a suspicion that maybe you know some things that I don't  \nknow. (Laughs.)\nT58: (Laughs.) No. \nC59:Mmm.\nT59:No, I'm not holding out on you. \nC60:Hey, I, I believe that. I, I ... it feels like I'm holding out on my self ... (T: Mmm.)  You  \nknow.  But hell, you know.  I don't know.\nT60:I think it goes back to some of the things you mentioned.  A man doesn't admit he's  \nhurt ... a black man especially doesn't admit that he's been hurt by anything. (C:  \nSure.) Uh, a father doesn't admit he's been hurt by being away from his children.  \nJust too many things that say: no, no, no ... don't let it out.  (Pause.)  But inside  \nthere's the hurt. \nC61:Yeah.\nT61:A phrase came to me a minute ago that, “If you could let that out, ...” I don't know  \nwhether this will ring true to you or not ...   “If you could let that out, it would be the  \nVoice of a Victim.”  I don't know if that makes any sense or not. \nC62:Mmm, yeah.  And I don't know what, you know, I don't know if I have any control  \nover that, (T: Mmm.) you know, of what, of what ... of what would happen, you  \nknow.  It's like a friend of mine the other day, who helped me through my illness and  \neverything, he says, you know, when I've encoun tered another person that, you  \nknow, a very intelli gent sort that was talking a bunch of intel lectual garbage about \nfeelings and things like that ... that I really wa ... wanted to just, to, you know, I  \nreally saw the ... him ... the society, the culture, right in him, you know.  (T: Mmm,  \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 93mmm.)  And I really wanted to just ... to kind of deck him, you know, and that's  \nsomething that's not uh my nature whatever, but I could just really wonder that ...\nT62:Mmm, just like to have socked him. \nC63:Yeah, yeah.  And my friend said, you know, \"one of these days\", he says, if you ...  \n\"if you don't get it together\" or, or somet hing, he says ... not \"that if you don't get it  \ntogether\", but he says, \"one of these days you're gonna really lose it, you know\".  \nYou know what I mean?  It ... it's that I want to get rid of all that stuff that was done  \nto me and not have to hear all that other stuff, (T: Mmm.) or to be able to deal with it  \nin a very (T: Mmm) con structive kind of a way, you know.  But still it grinds me  \nbecause of all the other stuff that's happened to me. (T: Mmm.)  And when I see  \nother people doing it to other people, or whate ver, it grinds me ... it makes me angry,  \nyou know?  And I would think that in those situations, I've begun to kind of strike  \nout, you know, or like you know, pro tecting somebody else or fighting for some body \nelse or whatever, and like I'm not sure what I did for myself, though, over those years  \nthat all that happened to me or what ever. (Pause.)   Annnd, if I could cry and have it  \nbe all right...\nT63:That's what I was thinking.  (C: That would be ...)  I was just thinking, if you could  \nonly cry. \nC64:Yeah.  It would, you know, but that's, that's a trip, you know ... that's a trip like uh...\nT64:First place, a man doesn't cry. \nC65:Yeah.  For sure, for sure.  That's a fact.\nT65:But I guess you're saying that times you have that lump in your throat and you sure  \nas hell feel like crying. \nC66:For sure, for sure. (Pause.)  Uhh, I don't know. (Sighs.)  I don't know.  Maybe going  \nto a movie or one of those old, you know, (sighs) movies, dramas, or something like  \nthat ... \nT66:Tear jerkers? \nC67:Right ...  so I can cry, you know, and have an excuse to cry, you know, but crying for  \nmyself, I'm not sure that, uh ... I'm just not sure that's going to be construc tive, you \nknow (laughs).\nT67:Mmm, you say you're not sure whether crying for your self is constructive.  I feel also  \nyou're afraid of crying for your self. \nC68:I may be, I may be, because if I feel like crying and I don't, whenever there's some  \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 94things that are, you know ... but you see, that's a part of it too, you know?  It's ... you  \nknow, and I, and I can't ... I, I hate to keep using these things of, you know, we're just  \nbeing so conditioned not to, you know, from a little thing of, you know, like oh, you  \nknow, \"be little, little men or big boys\", or whatever.  \"Don't cry\", and, and ...\nT68:Probably your seven-year-old could cry. \nC69:Yeah, for sure.  I cried, I remember crying, but I cried alone.  I never let anybody see  \nme cry, you know?  I wonder how many people have seen me cry! (Laughs.) (T:  \nLaughs.) Two or three in the whole world.  It's kind of interesting, you know.  I  \nremember living with my ex-wife, or whatever, she cried all the time.  She cried get -\nting up in the morning, and you know, just crying for crying, you know.  I asked her  \nsometimes about why she cried, and she just said, \"I don't know, just wanted to, felt  \ngood\".  I don't know if that was healthy or whatever, but it probably is a lot more  \nhealthier than what I did.\nT69:Mmm.  It probably is better than never letting anyone see you cry. \nC70:Right.  There's just so many other ways to do it, you know, that I've learned, you  \nknow, like working hard.  (T: Mmm.)  Not thin king about it, (T: Mmm) you know.  \nNot thinking about it.\nT70:Just seeing that all the sorrow that you feel for yourself and for what's happened to  \nyou and all that, uh, \"that doesn't really exist\".  It's just uh, you're too busy to have  \nany thoughts of that. \nC71:  For sure.\nT71:  But the sorrow is still there. \nC72:For sure.  Yeah.  And I really don't know how to de ... and I really don't know how to  \ndeal with that.  I really don't.  I really don't. (Sighs.) You know, just really giving so  \nmuch of yourself and it's really crazy.  Too much. (Sighs).\nT72:If you did cry, what would some of the themes of that crying be? \nC73:Well, just you know, all those, you know, hours that I, you know, that I spent away  \nfrom my family and that I gave up my family and didn't see my children grow, you  \nknow.  I really wanted that to be for some kind of a higher level, some kind of a  \ncause, you know.  But not to have that uh, to see anything, any benefit that I did.  \nYou know, all of that work, I mean, hours and hours and ... but it's just incredi ble, \nand I think that would be one, you know, I was saying, \"D amn it, why in the hell did  \nI spend so much time?\"  (T: Mmm.) \"Why did I spend so much time?\".  You know,  \nthe leukemia, the ... eve rything that happened to me or whatever would be proper ly \ndeserved if one person's life would have been changed, or somet hing, you know. (T:  \nMmm.)  And like, and may be, maybe it has or whate ver, but, but I think that I, I  \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 95don't trust that ... that it was worth it, you see?\nT73Mmm.  Yeah.  You invested a whole lot of caring, a whole lot of your self, and you  \nfeel real sorrow that maybe nothing came of that.\nC74Yeah, and I'd also like to uh just kind of cry for my father-in-law too,  who was  \nkilled before I ... (T: Mmm,mmm, mmm, mmm.) about six months before I got the  \nleukemia.  (T: Mmm) I'd like to really tell him that I uh, that I really loved him a  \ngreat deal. \nT74:Mmm ... So you're telling me in place of telling him  and maybe you could even  \nspeak to him, I don't know.  But at any rate, you really would like to tell him, \"I  \nloved you, you know that? I loved you\". \nC75:Well, I, I really would, you know. Th-thisss situation that we started out ... I was  \nmarried, and we married somebody of a different race, and we fought it out tooth and  \nnail or whatever, and but, but yet we loved each other and we fished together and he  \nwas great with me.  You know, he had a very ... to other people, a very cold way,  \nyou know, of, you know, \"By God, this is the way it's going to be\" and so forth.  But  \nI saw him when he was hurt too, and um when he was killed in, in 1975, in a, in a  \nhunting accident, it just really took all of it, you know.  (T: Mmm, mmm.)  Because  \nyou see, he helped me to, to try to get out of that stuff.  He's saying, \"Hey, what are  \nyou doing, you know? Do ... what do you really want to do?\".  And at the time I  \nwanted to, you know, to open my own restaurant or whatever. (T: Mmm.)  And so he  \nwas going to help me finance that restau rant, you know.  And so a week later he was  \nkilled.  One week.  And um, and so we were getting so close, but that I really never  \ntold him that, \"Hey Dad, you know, hey Dad, I love you, I really love you\".  And we  \ntold each other, I guess, in some ways or whatever, but it's not the same as saying it,  \nyou know, as saying, \"Dad, I really love you. I really care\".\nT75:You feel really sad that you never gave him a straight message on that, that \"I love  \nyou\". \nC76:For sure, for sure, because he was straighter th ... with me than a lot of people, you  \nknow. \nT76:Mmm.\nC77:And to now to be taken away from all of that, you see, because it's only been, I don't  \nknow, eight months or so since I ceased all communi cation with my family, you  \nknow, family that ... my wife's family that I've loved and I've cared for and that I  \nburied my father-in-law and that was it.  That was the ... and then even the family  \nbegan to take on those same things of the culture, you know.\nT77: Things began to fall apart for you there, mmm, mmm. \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 96C78:For sure, for sure, you know.  And lately, I don't know, falling apart or at least my  \nbeing able to see that uh that it really wasn't, it wasn't true.  (T: I see.)  It wasn't real, I  \nwasn't getting, I wasn't getting anything back, I wasn't getting any nourish ment back, \nyou know.  (T: Mmm, mmm, mmm) Smiles and polite kisses and things like that,  \nyou know.  That is, you know, part of the hurt, you know.  I'd rather for somebody to  \nsay, you know, \"I think you're a lousy S.O.B. or whatever\", as opposed to say ing, \n\"Hello, dear, how are you?\"  You know, you know?.\nT78:Mmm, mmm, mmm.  When the real message perhaps is, \"I think you're a lousy  \nS.O.B.\". \nC79: Right, right, you know.\nT79:Mmm.\nC80:(25 second pause).  Yeah, so there's, you know, there's a few things.\nT80:Part of the sorrow would be for your father-in-law.  You'd really weep for him. \nC81:I ... yeah, I think I would, you know.  And just maybe I still think that I really wish  \nthat I could, you know, just say, \"Hey, you know, you guys, you really don't realize  \nwhat you did to me\", you know?  Because for a while, I just, you know, saying, well,  \nyou know, \"racist\", \"terrible\", \"blah, blah, blah\".  But that doesn't say anyt hing, you \nknow, because it doesn't say how I really feel, you know.  (T: I see.)  But they, but it,  \nbut it ... they wouldn't understand that, they wouldn't understand how a black person  \ncould be hurt, you know, because if you don't accept a person as human, how can  \nyou, how can you think about, you know, like ... it's like thinking a dog could be hurt  \nof whatever, you know, people that don't have dogs and don't understand them, you  \nknow?\nT81:But you get some satisfaction out of saying, \"You people don't realize how much you  \nhurt  me\".  They  might  not  be  able  to  hear  that  message,  but  you'd  get  some  \nsatisfaction out of ... out of expressing that, out of ... out of letting, letting yourself  \nknow, letting others know that, \"God, I've been hurt!\" \nC82:Yeah.\nT82:\"I've been wounded\". \nC83:I just don't think I could do that 'cause I just don't think that that that, I just don't  \ntrust, you know, you know, I wouldn't do it becau se I just wouldn't want to give them  \nthe satisfaction, you know.  It's like I feel like, you know, my saying, you know,  \n\"Maybe that is my feeling\".  But I, I have too many times, you know, when you  \nknow, I opened up a little bit or whatever, and someone says ... (T: Mmm.) . .. you \nknow, squash!\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 97T83:So there are probably loads of people you wouldn't dare open up to on that,  but I  \nguess you're opening up to me to say, \"Yes, but I have been really wounded, badly,  \nby a lot of people\". \nC84:For sure. Mmm.  I maybe think that you can understand that a little bit in terms of  \nabout hurt and that, you know, that ... you know, that I, you know, that I'm a person  \nand uh, (pause) you know, I'm a person.  And I don't really want that denied to me ...  \n(T: Mmm.) you know, ever again. \nT84:Mmm, mmm.\nC85:You know. I could really get angry.\nT85:Mmm. mmm.\nC86:I don't you know, I just ... that's not going to happen to me, you know.  In a way, you  \nknow, I don't want to love anybody like I did my father-in-law again, and for God's  \nsake, you know, that's, that's pain ful, but I know that's terribly sick too, that you have  \nto love, you have to continue to love people.  Or whate ver. But at that time, it was  \nthe only thing that was producti ve.  It was the only thing that was something that  \nwas, you know, as Fromm talks about, biophi lic.  It was growth; it was nouris hing. \nAnd that was the only thing, and that was just taken away from me, and it was taken  \naway from me just ...\nT86:Just like that. \nC87:You know, It was just really strange, you know.\nT87:So that, that's been a ... a hurt and a shock and makes you feel, \"I can't risk myself  \nloving somebody else like that because that might disappear some way or other\". \nC88:For sure, for sure.  For sure.  I certainly don't want any more in-laws. (Laughs).  Be  \nthey uh whatever color.  I'm not sure I want them, but now you know ...  And that's ...  \nI think that's part of it, you know.  More so than, than the risking loving somebody,  \njust because their death ... death I know is inevi table.  But it's that, that other  \ncollection of things around it, or whate ver.  But you know, it's... it’s crazy.\nT88:It's what? \nC89:It's crazy to love, you know, it's just like loving a pet rock or something, you know,  \nit's nothing.  Nothing, you don't feel.\nT89:Mmm. mmm.  \"Love goes out from me but nothing comes back\". \nC90:Right.  And I'm not so sure that that, that I want that, it to work like that again, you  \nknow.  And maybe by ... maybe saying that, I don't know, maybe you know, cal ling, \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 98say, \"Hey, I really was hurt\" and everything like that or whate ver.  Maybe that would  \nbe a start or whatever, but I just don't really trust that they really under stand that.  (T: \nMmm) I don't really, really uh ... it took my wife who lived with me for seven years,  \nyou know, after I left, maybe six, seven months to understand that I was, that I was  \nhurt, that I was ... that I was desperate.\nT90:You feel there's so little chance of anyone else really under standing you. \nC91:Mmm, that sounds kind of, yeah, well, (small laugh), so little chance for that group  \nof people understanding me. (T: OK.)  And I believe it.  I really believe it, you know.  \nIt would just, it would be like me trying to, uh, to understand or to, to tell Dick Nixon  \nor something about my feelings, that I just don't think he could relate to that,you  \nknow. (T: Mmm.)  And I'm using, and ... and I'm really serious about that example,  \nbecause he's so far away from me and my reality, and that fami ly, you know, I found  \nout was so far away from me and my reality that, you know, it was insane, you  \nknow.  It was really insane, you know.  So I think on one level I feel OK for loving  \nthem.\nT91:You feel...? \nC92:OK for loving them.\nT92:I see, mmm, mmm.\nC93:But I don't feel OK for sharing any more with them. (T: Mmm.)  And sha ring that \nhurt is just, (T: Mmm) you know ... and maybe sharing it with other people would be  \nOK.  But I know I'm moving away from the other too, you know, that's really  \nimportant to me right now.  And I don't know ... maybe I won't ... I'm not rushing it,  \nit just seems to want to get out and jump out or whatever, but, you know, you know.  \nIt's clearly must have really gone through ... my body really must have gone through  \nsome changes or whatever because, you know, something there is just keeping it,  \nkeeping it down, and I know all those reasons but I can't uh, I can't seem to muster  \nthat power to ... (T: Mmm.) ... to get it, to get that out, you know, to really, you  \nknow.\nT93:It's still too much locked in. \nC94:Yeah, for sure.  But it really, it really helps, you know, um, 'cause it's, it's, it's just,  \nyou know ... it's incredi ble, you know, this is the first time I've talked to anybody  \nthat, you know, that I ha ven't really been in control.  To some extent I've really given  \nup a lot of control uh ... to you.\nT94:Mmm, mmm, sort of letting things loose rather than ... (C: For sure.) ... keeping them  \nunder your control. \nC95:For sure.\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 99T95:And that's a new experience. \nC96:A very new experience for me.  Very new experience.  And maybe I don't know if  \nit's just not, just it's a function, function of that too, you know, or something, you  \nknow.  Things are rattling around in my head now (laughs), you know.  But all the  \nother, it's just bullshit, and like I have been hurt and I really don't want to get  \ninvolved anymore in terms of with people that can't return love and can't accept  \npeople.  I just don't really want to get invol ved anymore.  I'm sick and tired ... sick of  \nit.\nT96:Sounds as though you're more accepting of yourself as a person who is vulnerable,  \nwho has been hurt, who is hurting, and who wants lo ve ... who doesn't want it all to  \nbe a one-way street of giving lo ve.  You want love back in return. \nC97:Mmm, mmm.  Yeah.  And I wanna be able to uh, to feel and to, and to cry.  (T:  \nMmm.)  And not to be afraid of crying, and, and not to be afraid of, uh ... I want to  \nbe able and I'm going to work for that.  I really wanna work for that.  I, I know I do,  \nyou know, I just have this thing, ah, you know.  If I trust the doctors, I'd have them  \ncut 'em, cut me open and get that out, you know, but I don't.  (Laughing.)\nT97:(Laughs.) Mmm. Probably'd be simpler to have an operation. \nC98:Oh yeah!  (Sighs).  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I, but do you, do you, do you, do you, do  \nyou feel that ... you know, like I really wanna, you know, tell you how hurt I am, but  \nI'm not, I can't tell you?\nT98:I understand that. I ... you're, you're uh, it visualizes in my mind you're walking all  \naround the edge of that pit, but you're not really letting yourself down into it; so  \nyou're letting me know all about it (clears throat), but, but not it. \nC99:Yeah.  For sure.  Yeah.  Don't know how to do that. (T: Mmm.)  You know?\nT99:Yeah.  I, I hear you saying, \"I really want to get to that, but it will have to be at my  \npace.  I can't ... I can't force it. I can't... but I do want to get to it\". \nC100:Yeah.  'Cause I want to get to it really fast, you know, because that's all a part of me  \nright now that's really ... I really feel that's sick, that's really the cancer, (T: Mmm)  \nyou know.  That if I could eliminate that, I could elimi nate all the cancer from my  \nbody. (T: Mmm.)  I really belie ve it, you know.  And I really blame, I really blame  \nthe way I lived and the stress and everyt hing else like that on, on on the disease.  I  \nreally do.\nT100:You mean, you blame the disease on all that stress, is what you mean? \nC101:Right, for sure, yeah.  I have it turned around.  For sure.  I do. I do.  And to some  \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 100extent, I blame racism. (T: Mmm, mmm.)  You know, I just don't want to get  \ncaught up into that anymore, you know, and I want to continue to give, but I don't,  \nI, I, I'm just not going to do it the way I did it before.  And uh, I don't know.  May ...  \nyelling sometimes  you know, like when I came in here, I was thinking about  \nyelling, you know, one of those long, big long ... you know.  But I'm not sure that I  \nwant to do that.  (Smiles.)\nT101:You could try it. \nC102:(Laughs.) You know, I don't know, you know (Laughs.)  That wouldn't be cultured. \nT102:(Laughs.) Standards, standards, standards. \nC103:Sure, I mean, I'm really, I was really socialized.\nT103:You were brought up right ... weren't you? \nC104:Oh yeah, I was.  I learned all of it ... all of it.\nT104:And still in spite of yourself, buy a good deal of it. \nC105:Yeah. Yeah.\nT105:You really don't want to, but still you find ... (C: Yeah.) ... you can't do the uncultu -\nred thing. \nC106:For sure.  There were standards, I guess, and uh, that are really foreign to me, but  \nuh, you know, the, the thing that, you know ... that I thought about you know, and  \nlike you know, I was like in terms of expressing my anger, whatever, comes out in  \nterms of, you know  (sighs), possi ble obscenity, you know (lau ghs), you know, like  \ncalling somebody a bunch of somet hing or whatever would really, you know, I  \ndon't know what it would do, but you know, I'd really like to do that, you know. \nT106:That helps to explain why I feel you've kept your language more, quite guarded  \nhere.  I, I, I realize I've used more profanity than you have. (Laughs.) \nC107:(Laughs.)  For sure, you know.  It's not because of, you know, but I don't know, it's  \njust a, a part of that, you know, like I was just ...\nT107:You'd like to just tell off the bastard! \nC108:Yeah, right, right, right.  For sure. (Laughs.)  Oh my good ness! (Laughs.)\nT108:You can't even do that.  (Laughs.) \nC109:(Sighs.) Oh, it's incredible.  I don't know.  Whew! I'm getting warm.\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 101T109:(Laughs.) Both inside and outside\nC110:Yes, right, right. I'm getting extremely warm.  Um, yeah, maybe I'll be able to do it  \none day, I guess.  Maybe I'll be able to do it (laughs).  I really haven't used ... but  \nsee, when I get out of here, I'll use a lot of profanity, you know.  I don't, you know,  \njust in terms of, you know, like I ... I, I, I, I think I did, you know, when I was really  \nangry  talking  to  my  wife  and  things  like  that,  you  know,  where  I  was  just,  \n\"Goddammit\", and all of that, you know, \"bastards\" and some other things and like,  \nyou know, I was raised properly, you know (laughs.). Uh, yeah, but I think part of  \nthat would be a part of expressing my (T: Mmm) feelings and everything like that,  \nyou know.\nT110:It wouldn't come out in nice, polite language. \nC111:No, it wouldn't.  It, it really wouldn't.  It really wouldn't.  To my teachers that I had,  \nto the family that I had, uh, to a lot of my colleagues, you know, and others.  And ...  \nbut I don't know if I really want to tell them, you know, maybe it's just a part of just  \nbeing proud and, and everything else like that, but at least to myself I, I need to get  \nit out and openly.\nT111:Yeah.  You may not tell it to them face to face, but you need to get it out of yourself  \nsomehow. \nC112:Mmm. Somehow, yeah, yeah.  Really rotten and I really feel s ... you know, really  \nscrewed.  I really feel ... (T: Mmm.) ... so badly.\nT112:\"The bastards really screwed me\". \nC113:Yeah, I know.  They ... they got me, you know.  It was just like uh, being part, I  \nguess, that had something to do with being in, you know, I guess, you know, I  \njust ... I just wipe 'em out, you know, if you don't get them with their bodies you do  \nit in their mind, you know, like it happened, you know, and it was ... it was real, you  \nknow, and you know, to try to describe that hell to somebody is just the, the hardest  \nthing, you know.  But it's like, you know, just somebody knocking you down ... (T:  \nMmm.) ... and it's somebody coming and stom ping on you and spitting on you and  \neverything like that, and like it's just, you know, and just being at ... feeling like  \ngarbage. \nT113:Mmm, mmm. \nC114:And I have the feeling that people have made me feel like garba ge, you know, and \nlike ...  you know?  I'm sure that my friends would say, you know, God, I had  \neverything. But I didn't have everything.  I didn't have everything.  Cer tainly didn't \nhave that respect as a person.\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 102T114:But there were a lot of people who, though they may or may not have beaten you  \nphysically, treated you in a way that just tram pled on you and beat you up and spit  \non you and made you a nobody, a piece of garbage. \nC115:Right.  And it won't happen again.  Not if I can help it (small laugh).\nT115:Mmm.\nC116:It's 'cause I'm really tired of fighting.  (T: Mmm.)  Really tired of expen ding that \nkind of energy. (T: Mmm.)  It really is just, is straining, it's too drai ning, and like, \nyou know, I don't really know what's gonna happen in terms of, you know, how I'm  \ngoing to do that, you know.  Get it out or (sighs) or whate ver, but you know, I just  \ndon't really want to say that I'm hurt or whatever, because that is ... that isn't even  \ndescriptive (small laugh) enough for what really happe ned.\nT116:Yeah.  To say a word like that or several of the words you've used just isn't at all the  \nsame as feeling those feelings inside and really feeling them fully. \nC117:It really is, uh, I don't know if you saw \"The Excorcist\", but it really is, really is,  \nyou know, that oohf, you know, I remem ber a scene in that movie where the girl  \nwho threw up this green slime, you know, and that's really, it's that, you know, it's  \nthat bad, you know, it's, you know, it's that, it's that bad.  'Cause I know it ... I know  \nit now, you know.  It's not a part of me and my body really wants to reject that, but  \nhow to, how to throw that up is ...\nT117:Yeah, how to ... how to vomit up that green slime that's been a part of your  \nexperience. \nC118:Yeah.  Maybe I'm just afraid I'll look horrible, you know, or, or that I'd look  \nhorrible, or whatever, expressing that kind of anger, that kind of uh, that kind of  \nhurt or whatever.\nT118:You wouldn't look civilized; you wouldn't look cultured. \nC119:(Laughs.) I don't, I don't know, you know. (Sighs.)  I don't really know.  But right  \nnow, the ... more than getting that out, I think the, uh, the overriding thing is that I  \nwanna keep at least that control, to control that, for fear of, you see, I don't really  \nwant to get sick again (T: Mmm, mmm.)  You know, and like I think this, the  \nslightest, you know, just by being weak, by submit ting to that kind of pain, um,  \nsomehow bring back my uh ...\nT119:You wonder about that ... whether if you, if you let out all the ... all the hell that  \nyou've experienced inside, it might uh, it might bring back your ill ness. \nC120:And that doesn't sound logical, does it?  (Laughs.) I know that.  (T: Smiles.)\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 103T120:O.K. (Laughs.)\nC121:Thank you, thank you very much. (Sighs.)  Oh, God.  What a ... mmm. (20 second  \npause).  I don't know.  God, you know, I feel so beaten.  I ... when I feel beaten  \nright now, and I'm not sure why, but that in a way the, that I got, uh ... I really got  \nsomething to say and it just, you know, and I know I'd feel better.  But maybe I w -\nouldn't, you know, I really talk ... God, I realize how I'm talking in cir cles.  I seem \nto be talking in circles.  Does it sound like uh?\nT121:No, not quite.  It's more spirals, I think. (C: Laughs.)  Get ting, as you say, getting  \nvery close, you feel, you feel beaten right now as though, if only something could  \ncome out, you wouldn't feel bea ten. \nC122:(Pause) Yeah (sighs)  Think that you know, just ... that turned, that almost turned  \nme into something really inhuman.  \nT122:Mmm.\nC123:I really almost let it turn me into something really inhuman.\nT123:It damn near made an animal out of you. \nC124:Damn near, damn near, yeah.  So you see, if uh, I don't want that to happen  \nanymore.  At all.  Not gonna do it to me again (laughs).\nT124:No. That's very clear. \nC125:No.  I know that doesn't help the other problem, but at least I know that (laughs),  \nand I really do know that, you know.  (T: Mmm, mmm.)  Becau se I don't think \nanybody has a right to do that to anybody.  Nobody ... teacher, wife, husband,  \nwhatever.  Uh uh, and it, and it really wasn't my fault either and uh, and like I'm not  \nthe blameless ... I mean, I'm not wit hout any blame or whatever, but you know, you  \nknow ... just like somebody took a big goddamned tree and just rammed it up ...  \nooh, so, you know? (Sighs.)  Hard to describe, you know, you know?\nT125:Took a great big stick and rammed it up your ass ...  Is that what you're saying? \n \n C126:(Laughs.)  I, I didn't say that.\nT126:Is that what you meant? \nC127:That's what I meant.\nT127:OK.  That's what I want to know, whether I was catching your meaning correctly. \nC128:Yeah, for sure.  You know, and you know that that probably would be painful.  \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 104(Sighs.)\nT128:And it's that kind of pain that you've suffered. \nC129:Yeah. (Pause).  You just can't let it ... I just, I just can't let it happen again. (Sighs.  \n18 second pause.)  I um really, uh, I just really don't know how to tell you how  \nbadly I've been hurt, you know.  I really don't.\nT129:Goes beyond words. \nC130:Yeah.  But I know, you know, it's there, and maybe I should attend to it a little bit  \nmore.  But, goddammit, you know, just ooh...\nT130:You're feeling some of that hurt now. \nC131:Yeah.  I am.  I was thinking a ... about a wino on a street that continues to drink,  \ndoesn't have a place to live.  You know I've seen so many people go by, they're the  \nkind of person, you know, disgus ting, don't want to work or whatever.  But you  \nknow, I really feel like there may be some reasons. (T: Mmm.)  And I know one  \nthing, I'm gonna allow that person to be desperate ...  (T: Mmm, mmm.) Because  \nI'm thinking that proba bly people like that do things out of despera tion.  And um, \n'cause I know, you know?   I never really had a drin king problem or anyt hing like \nthat, but it's the kind of sensitivity that I've gotten from all of that.\nT131:Mmm, mmm.  It seems, it seems to me that you're uh feeling it ... you know what  \nit's like to be in desperation and you know what it could drag you to, and so maybe  \nthat’s what’s happened to some of them.  Something like that. \nC132:For sure.  For sure.  And I think that I ... I think my, my heart goes out to people  \nlike that, people who can't afford to to do this or whatever, and ... because see, I had  \na lot of money and you know, it all left.  And uh, but in a way I'm hap pier now, you \nknow.  But I really don't know, not sure really where to go next, but I know that I  \ndon't really want that kind of life anymore.  That I wanna give, I wanna help, and I  \nwanna talk to people or whatever, and before I do that, you know, I wanna get my  \nthing together, and a part of that is just maybe admitting, you know, and I guess  \nmaybe admitting that I'm hurt and showing and expressing my hurt or whatever  \nwill, will reaffirm the fact that I'm a person (T: Mmm, mmm.)  Because apart from  \nthat, I think showing that is a, you know, pulling myself up too high, (T: Mmm.)  \nyou know, and that’s what everybody, you know, that's the way everyt hing was.\nT132:\"I don't, I don't feel it ...  I don't hurt, I'm, I'm fine\"... That’s a lot of bullshit. \nC133:For sure.  But at least I'm admitting to you that I'm hurt, you know.\nT133:Yeah, that's right, mmm.  And just for a moment there, I felt you really were  \nexperiencing that too, really feeling that stick shoved up your ass. \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 105C134:Oh, yeah, you know, when I, you know, what is, you know how your natural  \nreaction, you know, when you start feeling stuff like that, or at least when I do, I  \njust kind of, you know, I've got to put it all out of, out of my mind, bring it down to  \na different level.  And I think that's what I'm doing, I keep doing, you know, when I  \nget to the point.  Gotta bring it to a safe level.\nT134:Yeah.  That's right.  You get that close, you get that close to the pit and then pull  \naway a little. \nC135:(Pause.) For sure.  You, you ... is it all right to have every body else to blame?  \n(Laughs.) (T: laughs.) You know, for your, for your problem, instead of sharing  \nsome of that.  But I sha red, you know, I, I, I think I've really, I shared that, you  \nknow.\nT135:I think ... I think what you're saying is, \"I feel as though, dammit, every body else is \nto blame.  My mind says, Oh, no, you have, you probably have a part in it too,  \nbut...\"  (C: Sure. Sure.) ...your feelings are ... \nC136:Yeah, yeah.  And I guess I hurt myself.  I didn't, other people ...  maybe if I can  \nclarify that ... I let myself be hurt. (T: Mmm, mmm.) You know, because I just gave  \ntoo much, you know.\nT136:Mmm.  Made yourself vulnerable sometimes. \nC137:Really.  And not sometimes ... most of the times.\nT137:Most of the times. \nC138:You know, by being, you know, just by being, by sharing, by being there, by  \ngiving, you know, and really loving.  Because I do have that sense of a total, you  \nknow, that just, I wanna love, that's my nature. \nT138:Mmm, mmm.\nC139:But you know, I, I've really never been this beaten.  I never ... you know, never  \nhave.\nT139:I want to be clear about your meaning.  You've never felt so much of being beaten  \nas you do right now?  Is that what you're say ing? \nC140:Well, through this whole thing, you know.\nT140:Yeah.\nC141:Just beaten, you know, just really beaten, and I think that if I show you how much  \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 106I've been beaten or whatever, you know, like I'd proba bly, you know, become  \nnothing in this chair, you know, just ... (T: Mmm, mmm.) You know?  (Laughs.)\nT141:You might practically disappear if you really let me know how hurt and beaten and  \nawful you feel. \nC142:Mmm, for sure.  For sure. You know, I could tell you some times I mean that would  \njust, you know, maybe blow you away, you know. (T: Mmmm.) ... (Sighs and  \nappears on the edge of crying during a 20 second pause.)  Really too much for me.\nT142:Hmm? \nC143:It's really too much for me.\nT143:Too much.  Mmm. \nC144:I feel like it.\nT144:I, I think you feel as though, \"I've gone about as far as I can go at this point\". \nC145:Yeah.  Mmm, yeah, really. (Laughs.)  When I start smiling, I know I am.\nT145:Mmm.  Taking a drink of water. \nC146:For sure. (Laughs.)  Well, you know, but I'm being truthful about it anyway.\nT146Mmm, yeah.  Yeah, I feel, I feel too.  Uh, you've walked around that pit of hurt and  \npain and beaten-ness, and you've, you've felt some of it and uh, and perhaps that's  \nas far as you can go right at this moment. \nC147:Yeah.\nT147:Even though you know there's more there, you know that you're keeping some of it  \ndown.  Um and to know those things may be help ful too. \nC148:Yeah.  You see, because I, I can talk about this leukemia and and all this stuff and  \neverything like that and ... (T: Mmm, mmm.) well, I guess it's you know...\nT148:Fascinating.  And it's easier to talk about leukemia and the possibility of death and  \nall that, than it is to talk about all the hurt and awfulness that you've suffered.\nC149:Yeah. (Sighs.) Whew, oh, I really, whew, a lot, you know (sigh s). I have to stop. \nOK?\nT149:OK.  All right, mmm.  Gone about as far as you can go. \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 107C150:Right.\nT150:Mmm.  OK, we'll call it quits. \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 108FINAL COMMENT BY ROGERS\n[Source: Box 137/4, Carl Rogers Papers, Manuscript Division, Library of Congress,  \nWashington, DC]\nHere is an armor-plated man.  He has been sufficiently hurt that he hides his real  \nfeelings very deeply.  But in this relationship, the armor begins to crack  - just  begins to \ncrack.  He says, \"This is the first time I've ever talked to anybody that I haven't really been  \nin control\".  So in this understanding climate he lets himself creep closer to the experiencing  \nof his feelings.\nMy image is that he is walking all around his own private slough of despond.  We  \nfind the upper layer is anger, but further down in the slime are the unspeakable hurts, and  \nthe feelings of being tramped on, defeated and humiliated.  He gets so close to experiencing  \nsome of this, that his expressions become eloquent nonverbal communication: \"Ooooh!\"  \n\"Whew!  Whew, oh, whew!  I've got to stop\".  I feel that at that moment he puts his foot into  \nthis dreaded pit, but then has to draw back.  I don't regret this.  I regard it as demonstrating  \nthe wisdom of the client.  He knows where the worst spots are in his experiencing.  He  \nknows what he can tolerate.  He has to proceed at his own pace.\nAlong  the  way  we  see  how  powerful  metaphor  is  in  the  deeper  ranges  of  \npsychotherapy.  Metaphor is so much more expressive than an intellectual description...  The  \nlump in his throat...  The ability to speak from \"up here\" and not from \"down there\"...  The  \ngoddamn tree stuck up his ass...  The green slime that must be vomited...  They all speak  \nvividly of his feelings, without naming those feelings.\nFrom an intellectual and theoretical point of view there are bits that fascinate me.\nHis introjected self is his cultured self, the quotes \"credit to his race\".  It has little  \nrelation to the real feelings in which he could discover his real self.\nAnother bit.  He reports very convincingly that if he let his feelings all out, it would  \nmake him sick again.  But hearing those exact words spoken acceptantly by me, makes him  \nrealize it's a ridiculous view.  To me that's a fascinating interchange.\nHere’s another bit.  When I give him full permission to be as angry as he wishes,  \nthat stops him completely.  Then he can no longer avoid the fact that it is not his anger that  \nhe is afraid of, but the hurting and vulnerable part of him.\nThen there is the mourning which accompanies unexpressed love, the love for his  \nfather-in-law  which  he  was  never  able  to  communicate.   I  think  he  gained  from  \ncommunicating it to me.\nFinally, he makes it very clear that for him there are many more frightening aspects  \nof his life than the prospect of death.  Somehow this seems to contain a message for all of  \nus.\nAs for me, I felt very present in the relationship, an understanding companion on this  \ntrip of exploration which seemed so potentially dangerous to him.  I think it is a good  \nexample of how I work with an articulate client.\nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, Post-Session Commentary, page 109",

CARL ROGERS PART I -- DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM\n[Before the Interview]\n\"From my own years of therapeutic experience, I have come to feel that if I can \ncreate the proper climate, the proper, relationship, the proper conditions, a process of \ntherapeutic movement will almost inevitably occur in my client. You may ask, 'What is \nthis climate? What are these conditions? Will they ",
            "exist in the interview with the woman \nI am about to talk with, whom I have never seen before?' Let me try to describe very \nbriefly what these conditions are as I see them.\nFirst of all, one question is, can I be real in the relationship? This has come to \nhave an increasing amount of importance to me over the years. I feel that genuineness is \nanother way of describing the quality I would like to have. I like the term 'congruent', by \nwhich. I mean that what I am experiencing inside is present",
            " in my awareness and comes \nout through my communication. In a sense, when I have this quality, I am all in one piece  \nin the relationship. There is another word that describes it for me. I feel that in the \nrelationship, I would like to have a 'transparency.' I would be quite willing for my client \nto see all the way through me, that there would be nothing hidden. And when lam real in \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria, Introduction, page 2this fashion that I'm trying to describe, then kn",
            "ow that my own feelings will often bubble \nup into awareness and be expressed, but be expressed in ways that won't impose \nthemselves on my client.\nThen the second question I would have is, will I find myself prizing this person, \ncaring for this person? I certainly don't want to pretend a if I dislike my client \npersistently, I feel it is better, that I should express it. But I know that the process of \ntherapy is much more likely to occur and constructive change is much more likely, if I \nfeel",
            " a real spontaneous prizing of this individual with whom I'm working, a prizing of \nthis person as a separate individual. You can call that quality acceptance, you can call it \ncaring, you can call it a non-possessive love if you wish. I think any of those terms tend \nto describe it. I know that the relationship will prove more constructive if it's present.\nThen the third quality, will I be able to understand the inner world of this \nindividual from the inside? Will I be able to see it through h",
            "er eyes? Will I be able to be \nsufficiently sensitive to move around inside the world of her feelings so that I know what \nit feels like to be her so that I can sense not only the surface meanings, but some of the \nmeanings that lie somewhat underneath the surface. I know that if I can let myself \nsensitively and accurately enter into her world of experience, then change and therapeutic  \nmovement are much more likely.\nWell, suppose I am fortunate and that I do experience some of these attitudes",
            " in \nthe relationship, what then? Well, then a variety of things are likely to happen. Both from  \nmy clinical experience and from our research investigations we find that if attitudes of the  \nsorts that I have described are present, then quite a number of things will happen. She'll \nexplore some of her feelings and attitudes more deeply. She is likely to discover some \nRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria, Introduction, page 3hidden aspects of herself that she wasn't aware of previously. Fee",
            "ling herself prized by \nme, it is quite possible she'll come to prize herself more. Feeling that some of her \nmeanings are understood by me, then she can more readily perhaps listen to herself, listen  \nto what is going on within her own experience, listen to some of the meanings she hasn't \nbeen able to catch before. And perhaps if she senses realness in me, she'll be able to be a \nlittle more real within herself. I suspect there will be a change in the manner of her \nexpression, at least this ",
            "has been my experience in other instances. From being rather \nremote from her experiencing, remote from\nwhat is going on within her, it's possible that she'll move toward more immediacy of \nexperiencing, that she will be able to sense and explore what is going on in her in the \nimmediate moment. From being disapproving of herself, it is quite possible she'll move \ntoward a greater degree of acceptance of herself. From somewhat of a fear of relating, she  \nmay move toward being able to relate mor",
            "e directly and to encounter me more directly. \nFrom construing life in somewhat rigid black and white patterns,' she may move toward \nmore tentative ways of construing her experience and of seeing meanings in it. From a \nlocus of evaluation which is outside of herself, it is quite possible she will move toward \nrecognizing a greater capacity within herself for making judgments and drawing \nconclusions. So those are some of the changes that we have tended to find and I think that  \nthey are all o",
